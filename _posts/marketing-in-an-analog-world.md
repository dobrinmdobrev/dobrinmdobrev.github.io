- First, the analog and the digital are two very different types of worlds, and each has their own distinct set of benefits.
- the value of these different sets of benefits will vary based on a variety of factors
	- such as product type, buyer characteristics, or geographic location. 
- the relative value of analog benefits and digital benefits affect the relationship between these two different types of technologies.
-  within each of these four different types of analog and digital relations(dominance, resistance, synergy, and transformation) we see regularly occurring patterns across many different products and services.
## 0.1. Course overview
Course Description 
- Our new Digital World is dramatically changing the way products are created, promoted, distributed, and consumed. Although these changes have been revolutionary, we still live in an Analog (or physical) World. For example, even today, over 90% of all sales are still conducted in Analog stores. Thus, both marketers and consumers must simultaneously navigate both the Analog and Digital Worlds on a daily basis. Although the Digital Revolution has received considerable attention in recent years, the impact of this revolution upon the Analog World has been largely ignored. This course examines this issue by asking, "How has the Digital Revolution impacted Marketing in an Analog World?"
- This course will begin with an exploration of the key differences between the Analog and the Digital and then examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community. I hope you will join us in this educational adventure.

# 1. Module 1: Digital Dominance of the Analog World
### 1.1.1. Reading 
Adrienne La France (2016), "Archeology's Information Revolution," Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/digital-material-worlds/471858/

## 1.2. Digital vs. Analog
Analog and digital are most commonly thought of as two different types of signals. In essence, an analog signal is continuous in nature, while a digital signal is discrete, usually expressed as zero or one. These two types of signals are quite different. For example, analog signals produce sine waves. While digital signals produce square waves.

analog technology captures sound waves as they naturally occur. While digital technology converts these natural waves into a set of zeros and ones.
- the song played on the computer had less noise and distortion.
	-  this conversion process helps filter out unwanted noise, but it also loses some authenticity in the process.
-  the song played on the turntable sounded a bit warmer and perhaps more authentic.
- analog technology more accurately portrays a sound or a video in ways that can be both good and bad.-

> The analog is a closer representation of reality, while the digital alters this reality in some way.

> The analog world provides a foundation that is amplified by the digital.- 
> <div class="signature"> - David Bell </div>


- Indeed, the analog is our foundation and includes everything that has not yet been digitized. 
- Even activities that have become digitized often have an analog component.
- Although the digital world is new and shiny, the analog world is where most things still actually happen.
- According to archeologists, human civilization is about 10,000 years old. During most of this period, our lives have been solely analog in nature. The digital revolution is a recent event in our human history. It began in the early 1980s with the introduction of the personal computer, which allowed for the widespread digitization of information. Although 99% of all the information in the world is now digital, before 1980, less than 1% was in digital form. 
- Our analog foundation is being reshaped by the digital.



### 1.2.1. Digital benefitts
#### 1.2.1.1. Affordability
Because of it's intangible nature, marketing activities in the digital world are usually more affordable than those in the analog world.

#### 1.2.1.2. Visibility
At present, nearly half the world's population, that's about 3.5 billion people have Internet access. So digital activities have the potential for a very high degree of visibility. As a result, even small firms can attract lots of attention for their products and services.
```ad-example
title: Dollar shave club
collapse: close
```

#### 1.2.1.3. Conversability
In the analog world, most of our conversations both good and bad, about a particular product or service are limited to our friends and family. However in a digital world, these conversations often occur across a much broader range of people.
```ad-example
title: For example, consumers with large numbers of online followers on social media often post complaints about bad product experiences. And these postings are sometimes read and even responded to by the firm that they're complaining about.
collapse: close
```

#### 1.2.1.4. Trackability
Nearly all of the activity in which we engage in within the digital world leave some type of trace.
```ad-example
title: For example, if we purchase something from the online retailer, this company has a record of our name, address and credit card information, as well as our search and purchase history. In contrast if we bought the same product with cash from the physical retailer, this company would have none of this information.
collapse: close
```


### 1.2.2. Analog benefits
#### 1.2.2.1. Sociability
Now although the digital world allows us to participate in conversations across a much wider variety of people. The analog world allows us to engage in deeper types of social engagement with others.

```ad-example
title: For example, having a face to face conversation with the owner of a local store is a much richer social experience than submitting an email inquiry to a digital retailer. In addition to direction conversations, we also crave being in social settings with others. Which is one of the reasons why we often like to watch movies in the theater or drink our coffee at a local coffee shop
collapse: close
```

#### 1.2.2.2. Tangibility
Due to its basic nature, the digital world is intangible and largely appeals to just two senses, sight and sound. At present, it is hard to smell, taste or touch a digital object. So things in the analog world have much greater tangibility, which can be leveraged by marketers. For example, a large body of research suggests that many consumers, including me, have a high need for touch. And are more likely to buy things if they can touch them prior to purchase

#### 1.2.2.3. Excitability
The digital world's ability to excite us is limited by the size of our screens, the quality of our speakers and the speed of our Internet connection. In contrast, the analog world is less dependent upon electronic technology, can excite us in many different ways.

```ad-example
title: For example, attending a live performance of your favorite music star or your hometown sports team is typically much more exciting than watching these events, if you can, on your smart phone. 
collapse: close
```

#### 1.2.2.4. Annonimity (lack of pri 
This is a problem because sometimes we don't want others to know what we're doing, we want anonymity. Now it is much easier to be anonymous in the analog world than a digital one due to the lack of digitization.




### 1.2.3. Digital Dominance
- when the benefits of the digital are greater the benefits of the analog, we tend
- In which things that were formerly analog are increasingly becoming digital in nature.

### 1.2.4. Analog resistance
 - when the benefits of the analog are greater than the benefits of the digital
 - in which things appear to be relatively untouched by the digital revolution.

### 1.2.5. Analog and digital synergy
In some cases, the multiplicative benefits of the analog times the digital are greater than the benefits of just the analog or the digital by themselves.

### 1.2.6. Analog transformation
cases in which the benefits of adding the digital to the analog are greater the benefits of just the analog alone. And actually changes the nature of the analog activity. 
```ad-example
title: For example, many schools and universities are now using a technique called blended learning. In which students obtain course content the online video lectures and then engage in hands on activities when they come to the physical classroom.
```

## 1.3. Basic Concept
### 1.3.1. Domination

By moving from the analog to the digital, music listeners have greatly benefited from affordability.
Likewise, musicians and producers have greatly benefited from visibility
for many music consumers and marketers, analog benefits such as sociability and anonymity are not particularly important. Most of us like to listen to music on our headphones while we're walking, studying, or exercising. And we usually don't worry if someone knows what we're listening to. Thus the potential loss of sociability and anonymity are not major concerns for most of us.
the benefits of the digital greatly exceed the benefits of the analog. As a result, this product has become dominated by the digital.

## 1.4. Key Concepts: Efficiency
Type of digital dominance
A condition in which a digital product/service is preferred to its analog alternatives due to its ability  to provide a more efficient solution (in terms of money, time , energy) by leveraging digital tools.

1. Efficiency comes in many forms
favorable input-to-output ratio. When something is efficient, the amount of input required is low or the amount of output is high. Now, most activities in life require us to input at least one of three things: money, time, or energy. Sometimes, we have to input all three of these scarce and valuable resources. 
If the inputs of these investments can be reduced or made more efficient by digital tools, we'll see examples of digital dominance. 

2. wini-win
provides benefits to both the buyer and the seller.
In most cases, efficiency leverages the digital benefits of affordability, and to a lesser extent, trackability. For example, web-based knowledge sources like Instructables typically provide lots of information for free. In addition, by installing cookies on your computer, these websites have knowledge of your browsing behavior and can direct you to information offerings that closely match your needs and wants.
3. **addition by subtraction**
 The basic idea behind this phrase is that sometimes, things get better and we take something away. This stands in contrast to our typical assumption that the more we add to something, the better it gets. 
 
### 1.4.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 1.4.1.1. Be patient
 Many people seem to be reluctant to change especially changes that require them to alter their behavior. reluctance to change behavior is a challenge facing many offerings that seek to employ an efficiency approach.
 As we discussed earlier, the digitization of analog products or services often entails the subtraction of things we commonly take for granted. This change may take customers some time to get used to.
 Thus, if you employ an efficiency approach, you need to have a long term perspective. And also, your customers may need some time to get used to a new way of doing things.
 
#### 1.4.1.2. Offer incentive
 - financial
	 - discount 
	 - a freemium model

#### 1.4.1.3. provide opptions
one of the features of the digital world is the ability to present a tremendous amount of information. One important type of information when employing an efficiency approach is info about other options that a customer can access in case the options that they select isn't available or doesn't work. This ability to readily provide a set of various options is a feature that is harder and more costly to provide in an analog setting. if you employ an efficiency approach, be sure to take advantage of this feature by providing your customers a few good options

#### 1.4.1.4. Share stories
ou have to think of the digital world as full of all sorts of cool technologies like the Internet, 3D printers, and smartphones. Indeed, these tools are very cool and without them we wouldn't have the digital revolution in the first place. However, the digital world is also about people. It's about connecting with people who we wouldn't have connected with before and it's also about hearing their stories. Thus, most successful digital initiatives are full of stories. As humans, we like to hear stories and also tell stories.
	nearly all social media platforms are just places we can share our stories, either in words or in pictures. Successful efficiency approaches are also platforms for storytelling. Amazon's a great example of this. 
	Well, as you can see from Jamie's testimonial, these stories can be quite powerful and help give digital offerings a personal and authentic vibe. Thus, when you plan on employing an efficiency approach, don't forget the feature, not just your product offering but also the stories that people are telling about it.

## 1.5. Key Concepts: Democracy
a condition in which a digital product/service is prefered to its analog althernatives due to its ability to provide greater access and inclusion by leveraging digital tools
(visibility and conversability)

1. Higher trust
- online reviews posted by regular people are more trustworthy than firm-sponsored messages and claims. Although not quite the same thing, a democracy approach also offers this promise of higher trust because its offerings come from real people, or cats, that seem more like us.

2. economies of scope
- economies of scale - as a quantity of something goes up, it's costs goes down, and its value goes up.
- economies of scope. This concept says that costs go down and value goes up, not by offering a larger quantity of one thing, but by offering a larger number of different things.
-  A democracy approach is more closely linked to economies of scope than economies of scale, because it offers customers the benefits of having lots of different things.
3. prosumers
- In the analog world, customers typically have a singular purpose. They are people who choose and use products and services.
- when a product or service is marketed via democracy, customers usually take on a more complex set of roles. In essence, these customers become more than customers.

### 1.5.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 1.5.1.1. Keep it fresh
In the digital world, content must be constantly updated in order to stay fresh.
- Digital offerings that employ a democratic strategy also need to remain fresh.
- For example, most university websites provide fresh content each and every day.
	

#### 1.5.1.2. peek behind the stage
- successful democracy initiatives typically exhibit a high degree of authenticity.
- This authenticity validates the concept of democracy, and gives customers the idea that these people are just like them.
- This creates a higher degree of empathy, and makes their marketing efforts more credible, and less commercial in nature.
> 
>- *the front stage* - present ourselves in a favorable manner
>- *the back stage* -  the part of us that we usually keep hidden from public view.
><div class="signature"> - Erving Goffman </div> 

- We hide the back stage, we really don't allow people to see how we really are. However, at times, a peek behind the stage can actually be a good thing. Because as the front stage of the digital world takes on a bigger part of our lives, we seem to be craving for a look at the back of the stage. A successful democracy initiative should do this from time to time.

#### 1.5.1.3. cult of personality
 The cult of personality can be employed to enhance the success of a democracy approach. 
 - paradox.
	 - Although the basic idea behind this approach is that *it gives the opportunity* from our people, and cats, *to be visible and take part in the conversation.*
	 - It also allows these people, and cats, to become digital celebrities, who often enjoy a cult of personality.
	 - This prospect of celebrity can be an important factor in terms of attracting both participants and customers to these democratic initiatives.
 - So if you employ a democracy approach, make sure that you provide a means for people, or cats, that participate in your initiative to create a cult of personality.
 
 
#### 1.5.1.4. splendid isolation
- I don't need no one.
- These initiatives are typically consumed in relative social isolation.
```ad-example
title: For example, when we read a movie review on Rotten Tomatoes on our computer, we're probably by ourselves and are not likely to discuss the details of this review to others. Likewise, you probably don't spend an evening with friends and family looking at Grumpy Cat photos. Or perhaps you do. Instead, you probably do this when you're at home or at work alone and bored.
```
- Although you might share these photos on social media and engage in brief conversations with others, this is really not much of a social activity. Now, if you recall from our introductory lectures, sociability was one of the benefits of the analog world, and not something that can be easily digitized. So if you're trying to employ a democracy approach, you should focus your marketing efforts on products and services that can be consumed in splendid isolation.

The Revenge of Analog: Real Things and Why They Matter Hardcover by David Sax 

## 1.6. Donna Hoffman: online consumer behaiviour
The Internet of things
he idea is that everyday objects are outfitted with sensors and actuators. Very small little devices that allow these objects to acquire or receive information as well as take action on that information, so it's really very straightforward. But the thing that's really interesting about it, a variety of factors have conspired to make this happen. So virtually any object in the world can be so outfitted, and then is connected to the Internet, and then connected to data in the cloud, which makes these objects smart. And the thing that's interesting from my perspective is where if we looked at social media, which is about consumers interacting with other consumers through media like the Internet, for example. The thing that's really interesting to me about the Internet of Things is there are billions of these things, many, many more than there are humans. All of these objects are interacting with each other, and their background ambient interactions are going to have a big effect on our interactions. And so I'm really fascinated by what will happen as these devices, which are much smarter than we are, or some are much smarter, and they're going to get much smarter than we are. They begin to have all these interactions. Sometimes, just that don't involve us, and yet those can have an impact on our own behavior. 

- One of the things we find particularly interesting about these interactions with objects is that they can have enabling or constraining capabilities. So on the one hand, we can be made more, better somehow. We can have a lot of positive outcomes from our interactions with all of these objects that are interacting with each other. Some of which don't involve us, and then some of our interactions with these objects are more direct. And many of those interactions can be positive. We call those enabling experiences in a city of such cars. It could happen in smart cities. A lot of different examples of that.
- the car can talk to other cars on the road. And the cars can make decisions about being leaders or followers, collaborators or sort of more agentic cars to make the traffic flow better for all of us, but then there's also a dark side. So in addition to these enabling characteristics from the consumer perspective, there are also these constraining experiences that we've uncovered in our research. Experiences where we might actually become less than we were before. We're self-reduced, and these reductions come because these assemblages of smart objects of which we are a part might actually limit us in ways where we can't behave to our full potential.

- If I'm ordering something from Amazon Alexa, or just talking to Alexa in general to adjust the temperature, lower the lights, play some music, let me know what the weather is. Whatever it might be, I have to talk to her in a very specific way. Otherwise, she can't understand the commands. That's actually pretty restricting, because one of the things that begins to happen is, I start to talk in that stunted speech maybe in my regular life when I'm talking to you. Because I'm learning the more I'm interacting with her and learning how I have to interact with her in order for her to do her job, someone that actually reduces me as a person. And so we think that's going to be a really interesting area.  we think that it's going to be more compelling to sell to consumers this concept of the IoT in the same way that Steve Jobs sold consumers the iPad way back in 2010. Steve Jobs put that out to consumers as everything you've always known, but more. And so there's this sense of wonder and excitement and experiences we can't even imagine if only we could bring them in and start to play with it. 
- Digital is embedded into the fabric of our lives. The thing that's interesting about the IoT is we've been living our lives on the Internet, online, for more than two decades. And the Internet of Things represents an opportunity to bring the digital into the physical world, because now the objects, the very objects that we interact and exist with, they are connected to the Internet. And so it's as if the Internet has come crashing into the real world. And now we have new opportunities for interaction that we can't even imagine what that'll be like in the next few years.
- it's too risky to say that many ordinary devices that we interact with in our lives, in the world, will be smart and managed to some extent, some smarter than others. So park benches will be smart. Trash cans will be smart. Our cars will be smart. The roads will be smart. Many aspects of our cities will be smart. We're seeing our homes are smart in ways in terms of, we'll see a big push in the next few years for energy consumption, better efficiency. There'll be a lot of work done. And just how to make the living of our daily lives better, more efficient, cleaner, safer. So we're seeing that right now. What will happen in 30 years as an outgrowth of that is difficult to predict, but I think it'll be very likely that many jobs will have been replaced by robots in many different industries.

# 2. Module 2: Analog Resistance to the Digital World
Democracy

David Sax (2016), “The Growth of Analog in a Digital World" http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2016-12-08/the-growth-of-analog-in-a-digital-world

## 2.1. Basic concepts: Analog Resistance
Analog resistance, what products or services come to mind? If you're like most people, you probably think of low-cost and frequently purchased products and services. the way which we obtain these products and services is not that much different than it was 30 years ago. And they've been largely untouched by the digital revolution.

for most people, including both candy bar marketers as well as consumers, the benefits of the analog still exceed the benefits of the digital. or many of us, candy bars are impulse purchases. A response to a craving for something sweet. Thus, they have a high degree of *tangibility*. When the impulse hits us, we want to buy it, hold it and eat it as soon as possible.
```ad-example
title: candy bar
- They usually contain high amounts of sugar and are low nutrients and add empty calories to our diet. So candy bars are a **guilty pleasure** and often have a some degree of **social stigma**.
	- Thus, buying candy bar from a store vending machine provides some comfortable *anonymity* from family members who may not approve of our junk food habit.
	- In contrast, for products like candy bars, the benefits of the digital such as *affordability* and *trackability* are not very important. 
		- Candy bars are already quite affordable. And it usually costs no more than a dollar or two.
Since they're guilty pleasures, the idea that our candy bar purchases are being tracked by someone is not a very appealing thought. As a result, for products like candy bars, the benefits of the analog appear to exceed the benefits of the digital.
```

## 2.2. Key conept: Physicality
physicality - a condition in which the analog product or service is preferred to its digital alternatives due to its physical qualities such as its shape, size, or weight.


Unlike an MP3 file, which can't be seen or touched, a vinyl record is big and bulky and usually comes in a eye-catching cover. This physical form gives vinyl records a sense of tangibility that can't be matched by its digital alternatives. This tangible aspect helps satisfy our need for touch, and also makes us value music more highly since vinyl records are quite fragile, and need to be carefully handled, and cared for. Also, some listeners claim that vinyl records produce a sound that is warmer and more authentic than an MP3 file. On top of this, the physical form of a vinyl record makes it especially appealing to music collectors who like the social aspect of hanging out in record stores such as this one, and also showing off their collection to their friends and family.
	- For example, a vinyl record has a distinct physical form while an MP3 file does not. For some people, this physical form produces a more enjoyable listening experience. For example, many fans of vinyl records like the fact that a record has two sides, it must be physically flipped in order to complete the listening experience. This simple act of getting up from the couch and turning the record over produces a tangible sense of satisfaction that they can't get for music in a digital form. 
	
```ad-warning
title: physicality leverages the analog benefits of *tangibility and sociability*.
collapse: close
```

 In today's digital age, fewer and fewer things are tangible in nature and our social interactions often come through a screen rather than in person. there appears to be a growing desire for the physicality that analog products and services can provide. 
 
 
 1. coexistence with the digital
```ad-warning
title: successful resistance doesn't exclude the posibility of coexisting
even though an analog product may be resisting the digital, there are more likely to coexist with a digital rather than totally replace it. 
```
```ad-example
title: both records and books coexist with their digital counterparts
These digital offerings, which are not going away, often used for other purposes (Get a different job done).
```

2. opposition to the digital
 part of the physicality appeal of the analog is a fact that it opposes the digital
 - analog products, such as a record or a book, are tangible entities that we have to touch in order to consume. The non-physical nature of the digital gives analog products, such as records and books, a new set of meanings.
	 - By opposing the digital mainstream, people who own analog products, like records and books are able to cultivate an image of being cool and hip
 - Digital offerings like e-books or mp3 files are intangible entities that are downloaded using a computer. Since these digital products lack physicality, we never touch them.

```ad-warning
title: Also the digital is no longer new. It's now mainstream.
As a digital world becomes mainstream, buying and using analog products and services are becoming part of the *counterculture*.
```

3. products have both form and function.
Typically we usually focus more a product's functionality then its form. However both of these qualities provide value to consumers.
```ad-example
title: For example while an MP3 music file may provide superior functionality over a vinyl record in terms of sound. This functionality comes in a very different form. To compete against this new digital offering, record manufacturers and retailers have tried to market vinyl's physical form and has positioned its physicality as a point of distinction. They realized that people are not really buying records to listen to music, they're buying records to own records, which is something that a MP3 file could never offer.
```

### 2.2.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 2.2.1.1. touchy feely
When we say someone is touchy feely, we usually think of this as a negative thing. However, when it comes to analog products, being touchy feely is actually a good thing.

Analog products can be touched and caressed. *many of us have a need to touch products. And that touching a physical product produces a sense of haptic satisfaction.* if we touch a product, we're more likely to buy it and may even pay more for it.

**Thus analog marketers can successfully leverage this power of touch by allowing potential customers to touch and feel their products as much as possible prior to purchase.**

#### 2.2.1.2. look for a partner
things that are alike can often be found together. People who are interested in buying one type of analog product or service are likely to be interested in other types of analog offerings. *(cross-selling)*
	allows people who are interested in one type of product discover a product that weren't initially looking for but may want to buy
	
#### 2.2.1.3. leverage rituals
Typically, rituals involve the purchase, use, and or disposal of different products.  Even though we live in digital age, most of these ritualistic objects are still very much analog in nature. One reason that rituals have resisted the digital maybe due to the fact that these physical objects are a better means of promoting sociability. Since most rituals are conducted in the presence of others, this superior sociability gives analog products a competitive advantage over their digital counterparts. 

Marketers can leverage analog's natural advantage as ritualistic objects by creating and celebrating more rituals.


#### 2.2.1.4. seek out collectors
Due to their physical form, analog offerings are also very appealing to collectors. As humans we have an innate desire to collect things(that are analog in nature).
Part of the joy of collecting is displaying your collection on your shelf, and showing it off as you explain how you obtained these various objects in your collection. In essence, collecting is both a tangible and sociable act.
Thus marketers of analog products should focus on selling not just objects, but collectibles.

## 2.3. Key conept: Protection

rotection as a condition in which an Analog product or service is preferred to its Digital alternatives due to its ability to shield its user from some the dangers, either real or perceived, of the Digital World.
protection leverages the analog benefits of *tangibility* and sometimes *anonymity*. It also arises when digital features, such as **visibility** or **trackability** become limitations rather than benefits.

1.  digital can be harmful
```ad-warning
title: the digital world can be harmful to our well-being. A growing number of studies suggest that too much time in the digital world can harm our minds, our bodies, our social relations, and even how we think about ourselves.
```
harmful to our physical, psychological, social, and financial well-being
- a recent survey conducted in the UK found that high levels of social media usage is linked with *anxiety, depression*, and the *fear of missing out*, or FOMO.
- CLA, suggests that our reliance on digital devices may interfere with our *sleep* and actually contribute to *obesity*.
- harmful to our *financial* well-being in the form of identity theft, stolen credit card numbers, and online bank robberies.
	
2. protection comes in many forms
Unfortunately most analog products and services provide protection from only a few of these dangers.people who are concerned about the dangers of the digital will need to employ subtle forms of analog resistance to gain fuller protection.

3. disconnect. 
different types of analog products and services provide protection from the digital in different ways. However, at their essence, all of them involve disconnecting from the Internet in some way for some period of time.
```ad-warning
title: By being disconnected from the Internet, the dangers of visibility and trackability are greatly reduced because we're harder to find and harder to follow when we're offline.
- In addition, when we are offline, we are more likely to appreciate the analog benefits of tangibility.
```
```ad-example
title: families are turning their devices durring dinner
Mitchels did it too
```
### 2.3.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 2.3.1.1. leverage low tech
 nalog forms of protection are generally low tech solutions such as switches, gears, and paper. In fact, they're low-tech nature is a key feature in terms of differentiating them from the high-tech world of the digital. Thus, if you are seeking to create and, or market an analog offering, keep it simple. Rather than coming up with a new technology, try to think of ways in which the old, the analog technology, can appeal to people seeking protection from the digital.

#### 2.3.1.2. turn digital strengths into digital weaknesses
The digital is not nearly as novel as it used to be. the digital world is something that most of us now take for granted and has lost some of its luster. Now that its novelty has worn off a bit, we are becoming increasingly aware of its potential dangers, such as too much online visibility and the risk associated with tracking our digital footprints. Thus, digital strengths, such as visibility and tractability, may now, at least in some cases, be seen as weaknesses, may be used to help market analog forms of protection from these dangers.

#### 2.3.1.3. the power of anonymity
It is becoming increasingly apparent that just about anything we do in the digital world, such as our browsing activity or online transactions, leaves a trail of digital exhaust that can be rather easily uncovered. Thus, a growing number of people are becoming aware of the benefits of anonymity. This power of anonymity may be leveraged by marketers in a variety of other domains.
```ad-example
title: Businesses such as airlines, coffee shops, and hotels can market the benefits of enabling anonymous, physical meetups as safe havens from the dangers of meeting and discussing sensitive information in an online setting.
```

#### 2.3.1.4. celebrate craftsmanship
In addition to offering the power of protection, analog products and services can further enhance their value proposition by marketing the benefits of *craftsmanship*. In our fast changing digital world the idea of craftsmanship can be very appealing. Objects that exhibit this quality are viewed as *rare, well-made, and highly valuable*, and this concept is tightly connected to the analog world.
In addition to being beautiful and inspiring, well-crafted objects also provide us with *a sense of permanence and stability*, which are important to our sense of psychological well-being. Thus, analog marketers could celebrate the craftsmanship of their products to gain a edge over their digital competitors.

craftsmenship: quality of work something made by hand

### 2.3.2. Markus Giesler: consumer culture, brands and technology
#### 2.3.2.1. why are people especially young people today still seeking analog experiences?
I think that when something is analog, is contained. It is there for me to enjoy and it's reliably accessible, whereas when something is digital, it's constantly in motion. It becomes portable and transferable. So, maybe this current resistance we're seeing to the digital and the sort of resurgence of the analog is a response to things being so liquid, being so in motion and consumers having a desire to stop it, to put what used to be no longer accessible back into a state where it becomes accessible, where it is unique, where it is something that exists for me and for me only.
 I think that when something becomes digital, it become so replicable that it loses its uniqueness, and maybe, we as humans don't necessarily have the need to stop things and the need for slowness but the need for uniqueness, the need to establish strong and enduring emotional bonds with objects. And when these objects are analog, they are more easily accessible to become something that's ours. And I think that's one thing that definitely drives the current return or resurgence of analog.
 
##### 2.3.2.1.1. Notion of physicallity
 Everyone who loves music and has had interactions with physical carriers of music like a vinyl record for instance, knows that music doesn't just sound, it also touches and senses and feels differently. So that when you have a vinyl record, you can establish a very different relationship not only with the artist and the art but also with yourself. So, that physicality that times sets, touch sense, and smell is something that's part of the experience that we don't have. When we listen to music on Spotify where all I have is just my cell phone and access to a database with a million songs. So, I think that is something that helps distinguish what I do as an artist, what I do as a marketer from others in the marketplace. So, that's why physicality matters because it adds materiality, it adds something that allows me to distinguish myself from the competition

being able to establish a very specific relationship between yourself and something that you actually have around.


##### 2.3.2.1.2. There is a difference between ownership and access.
That's the other thing. So, in addition to physicality, I used to just own my records. Now I'm accessing them. That's a different thing and maybe consumers desire ownership more than marketers thought they would.
##### 2.3.2.1.3. dematerialization and rematerialization
it also becomes dematerialized and less accessible in material form. But then at the same time, and that's the really fascinating thing, we're also seeing rematerialization. Things that used to be intangible are becoming tangible now, accessible, and portable, and ownable.

##### 2.3.2.1.4. Digitalization & materializtion
And that enriches the experience for us as customers. And some also a completely reversal of the digital revolution. Yes. Which began by taking analog things and digitizing them. Yes. And now we're taking digital things and making them analog. 

If you think about how we conventionally think about progress. We shouldn't make the mistake of always thinking about technological evolution as something that evolves towards the better. What we see here is that the digital and the analog, the material and the immaterial are interacting and interesting and complex ways to shape the markets that we live in and the landscapes that we as marketing managers need to navigate.

##### 2.3.2.1.5. Digital vs analon comparison
n analog object, something that exists as an analog representation is potentially more unique than its digital counterpart. Why? Because the digital counterpart can be replicated infinitely. that's an analog artifact that still has its uniqueness across time and space. digital objects can still be material but less authentic, and that is something that's interesting for marketers because, what we are trying to do is we're trying to make objects distinguishable and valuable to consumers, and authenticity is one of those variables that helps us accomplish that.

analog and digital has been culturally understood. When we think digital, we think replicability, we think transferability, something that's superficial. It has no depth anymore. But the analog, it has the depth. It has the depth quite literally and the kinds of sounds we hear differently, or the kinds of imagery that we can see and associate with analog. But also depth in terms of perception. How I think about something as analog is differently than what I think about it as digital.

##### 2.3.2.1.6. Difference accross generations
digital immigrant vs diggital native
Your sons are probably digital natives. You're an analog native. So, for you with the new world of digital becomes the environment within which you have to evolve into a new type of consumer. But it is interesting to observe that the other consumers are in some sense returning almost to the appreciation of analog similar to how we did when we were young. So, what we're seeing is a certain circularity and repetition of history in interesting ways. So, both analog and digital now coexist to shape our realities as consumers and different generations perceive those realities differently. But both of them draw upon digital and analog equally, I would say. 

Different lived experiences around the difference between digital and analog. 

##### 2.3.2.1.7. Retro branding
The analog could be thought of the analog object, consumption object, or a product could be thought of as a time capsule, something that carries meanings from an earlier point in time. And that's an additional aspect of consumption that often gets overlooked at. Something becomes desirable not because it exists in the present but because it represents the past. 
###### 2.3.2.1.7.1. is  retro branding effect is more pronounced for analog products than digital ones?
 I think there is a certain propensity or a characteristic about analog products that make them very conducive to carrying retro meaning. So, nostalgic idealized representations of the past because they are more authentic and more credible in carrying those meanings than digital objects. Although it's also possible to imagine a digital representation of a Beatles album that has nostalgic value to us as consumers because we may remember it from back in the day. But I think the analog representation is stronger, it's more emotional, it's more desirable for most consumers.
 
 I think it's important to remember that analog and digital coexist and that in order for us to succeed in an environment where this happens, we have to carefully understand how consumers perceive the relationship between these two in their everyday consumption. So, what are the experiences that analog and digital constitute? What are the conditions under which I as a consumer resist the digital through the analog and vice versa? Doing so can help us better understand consumption general but it also can make or break our momentum of success as marketing managers.

## 3.1. Basic Concept: Analog & Digital Synergy
Webrooming and showrooming are frequently employed for expensive and infrequently purchased products such as automobiles and appliances. ^ilf0e8
```ad-example
title: For example, when engaging in a process of searching for and buying expensive but infrequently purchased durable good such as a large screen television, analog shopping provides the benefits of tangibility. An analog retailer allows us to touch a TV and see its picture quality in a resolution, an up close and personal manner. On the other hand, you could probably buy this TV for a lower price if we engage in some digital shopping which provides the benefit of affordability. 
Thus by engaging in activities such as webrooming and showrooming we can enjoy the synergistic benefits of both the analog and the digital, combined.
```



Webrooming 
Showrooming
showrooming occurs when consumers examine a product in an analog store but purchased it from a digital retailer

Types of synergy between analog and digital:
- [[Marketing in an Analog World#11 Key Concept: Glocal|Glocal]] = the synergies between the analog benefit of *sociability* and the digital benefit of *visibility*
- [[Marketing in an Analog World#12 Key Concept: TouchTech|TouchTech]] = the synergies between the analog benefit of *tangibility* and the digital benefit of *trackability*. ^8acex0


## 3.2. Key Concept: Glocal
 a form of Synergy that is created when products or services combine the local aspects of the Analog with the global aspects of the Digital.
 This combination allows a local to become global, and vice versa
 A glocal strategy typically uses digital tools like the Internet, social media, or 3D printing, to provide greater access, or awareness, to an analog offering that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to globalize. 
 
```ad-warning
title: Benefits
```

 A glocal strategy creates synergy by combining the benefits of the analog and the digital, and reducing their limitations.
 Most typically, a glocal strategy combines the analog benefit of *tangibility* with the visual benefit of *visibility*. 
 
 1. Requires a crowd
	- a glocal strategy is really hard for a single individual to accomplish by him or herself, it typically requires a crowd to be successful. Having a broader collection of participants enhances both the global as well as the local aspects of a glocal strategy.
	- So being able to attract a crowd is critical, however, unlike a traditional crowd, which is usually located in a specific geographic place, a glocal crowd is really a diverse set of individuals located throughout the world, but they're connected through a digital thread. 
 2. Digital and analog co-dependencu
 	- digital is the enabler
		-  offerings that are glocal in nature have a codependent relationship between the digital and the analog
 	- analog is the enabled
		- the analog portion of the synergistic relationship is the local offering that is enhanced by its digital enabler.

```adwarning
title: codependency is a dysfunctional interpersonal relationship in which one person is an enabler, and the other is the enabled. Thus, being codependent is usually viewed as something very, very negative. However, for purposes of achieving digital and analog synergy, codependency is actually a good thing.
```

```ad-example
title: Digital tools like the internet, social media platforms, and 3D printing technology enable an analog offering to achieve synergistic effects. By making products or services that are local, more interconnected, accessible, and visible to a global audience. 
```

### 3.2.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 3.2.1.1. Find a champion
a glocal strategy may sound easy, but actually requires a substantial amount of effort and energy. Often the initial source of this energy is a single individual or small group of people who have a passion to spread an idea, and are successful in getting others to join in this effort.
Thus, a glocal strategy can begin in a single location at a very low cost. The key is to find a champion who is passionate about this initiative, and will develop the time and energy to spread the word, or better yet, you could be the champion.
#### 3.2.1.2. Find a palatform
glocal strategies seek to create synergies between the analog and the digital worlds. Typically, the synergy comes in the form of a local analog offering that is digitally showcased, or made available to a global audience.
This is the reason why this strategy represents a synergy between the analog and the digital. The key thing is to find the right platform for your specific analog offering. 

#### 3.2.1.3. Lower the barriers that prevent us from doing things
as limited financial resource, geographic distance, or lack of information
o if you're considering a glocal strategy, carefully think about the types of barriers it will help reduce. The greater the reduction of these barriers, the more successful the strategy is likely to be

#### 3.2.1.4. "give away the razor and sell the blades."
King Camp Gillette, the founder of the Gillette corporation, once said, give them the razor, sell them the blades. In marketing, this would become known as the razor and blades approach. It represents a business model in which one product is sold at a very low cost or given away for free, in order to enhance the sales of a complementary good.
This razor and blade model also appears to be a good way to monetize a glocal strategy.

## 3.3. Key Concept: TouchTech
 form of Synergy that is created in products or services that combine the physical features of the Analog with the high-tech features of the Digital. This combination provides the best of both worlds
 ```ad-warning
 title: benefits
 ```
 
Combining the benefits of the analog and the digital and or reducing their limitations
```ad-example
title: For example, the Freewrite combines the analog benefits of tangibility and anonymity while also reducing the limitations that occur from digital visibility and trackability.
```

Products or services that employ touchtech usually share some degree of physical resemblance to their analog predecessors, but look and perform differently due to their digital capabilities.

1. Singular focus (having 1 finction)
2. Haptic engagement (this haptic quality maybe both a benefit as well as a limitation depending on who's using a Touchtech offering.)
3.  dual competition
Due to their nature of being both analog, as well as digital at the same time, Touchtech offerings face the possibility of having to compete against both analog and digital competitors.

### 3.3.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 3.3.1.1. embrace or distance
Products and/or services that employ Touchtech either embrace or distance themselves from the digital world. 
The key thing to remember is that you need to clearly identify which approach you take.

#### 3.3.1.2. leverage the familiar.
All three of the Touchtech examples that we discussed in this lecture have something in common. They all leverage familiar behaviors. By mimicking the look and functionality of existing offerings, Touchtech products and services allow users to leverage existing habits and routines without having to learn new ones. This makes the marketing task much easier as the creators of these new offerings can focus on communicating their benefits and features without having to teach consumers a whole new set of habits and routines.

#### 3.3.1.3. make it smart
Most analog products and services are pretty dumb. There are things that don't transfer information to other products or services are difficult to update once they're created.
Touchtech makes these products and services much smarter by giving them the ability to transfer information and allowing them to be updated over time. Thus, these offerings often use the term smart as part of their marketing efforts to distinguish themselves from their analog equivalents. 


#### 3.3.1.4. solve a problem. 
Much like any marketing endeavor, to be successful, a Touchtech strategy needs to solve a problem that the user faces with their existing offerings. In some cases, users are aware they have a problem. In other cases they may not be. 

### 3.3.2. David Bell: digital economy. In particular, these brands, we call them digitally native vertical brands, brands that are born online and then continue offline.
#### 3.3.2.1. Surprising relationship between the analog world, and the digital world
```ad-warning
title: Analog is a foundation and the digital is the amplifier
```


eah, sure, so as we all know, we live both online and offline, as Eric said, in the analog world and also the digital world. So what's fascinating to me, as a student of the digital economy, is that even though in the digital economy access to everything is flat. So you and I, we live in different parts of the United States, but we could both go to a particular website, we could see the same products, the same prices, the same shipping. But our propensity to do that, might be different. Because you may have better access to local stores than I do, better pricing, different kinds of neighbors, and different options. And so the physical world that we live in, sort of shapes our offline options, it shapes who our neighbors are, what conversations happen. And those things sort of manifest in the way that we behave in the digital world. 

 there are certain things that you do, like maybe searching for information or touching and feeling products, or interacting with a service person. Certain things are just tailor-made for the digital experience. And certain other things are tailor-made for the analog experience. And the analog experience is sort of making a bit of a comeback. I think we all thought, even the two of us, that when digital came along, it was going to wash away analog. What it's done is it's just created a a different version of analog. because at the end of the day, as humans, we still like tactile experiences.
 
 we'll see the digital push further and further. So you might now do telemedicine instead of going to see your doctor, for example. So when Jeff Bezos, very clever gentleman, started Amazon he started selling books, because this book can be represented very easily digitally. Whereas this jacket, it's much harder to let a customer know what it's going to feel like. But maybe as technology advances, you could try it on virtually, use holograms >> 3D printing. >> 3D printing [LAUGH] exactly. So I think we'll see the digital continue to eat into the analog. And then the analog, I don't think will disappear, but will reinvent itself. 

#### 3.3.2.2. Generation differences
 digitals altering the physical? >> Yes, absolutely. So in particular, there are generational things there obviously, with younger people, so-called millennials and even younger, who spend a tremendous amount of time online. And to some extent, use it almost as a substitute for being offline. So if I'm online, I may actually not want to ever go into a store, for certain kinds of products. I may prefer just to interact through a digital medium. And I think we're going to see a lot of movement, Eric, in the area of commerce based on messaging. Of course, a lot of big players are interested in that too. So it's sort of very personal, one-on-one, kind of digital engagement
 
#### 3.3.2.3. the impact of the type of digital device that you're using
 geographic friction- the only things I could buy, were the things that were offered by my small town in which was not much
 We're more likely to sort of click on and investigate an option that's closer to us. So for every mile, an option is closer, the more likely we are to click. If we're performing that same function of search on our mobile device, we'll be even more captive to things that are close. And there are sort of two reasons. One is we're probably really in the mood to eat, that's why we're on the phone. And the second thing is this device makes us just much more aware of our local environment. And that's why the learners may have seen this in the media. The term local is such a big buzz word. Activating people in their local media environment. And the mobile device is certainly the way that happens at the moment.
#### 3.3.2.4. the impact location has on likelyhood of digital shopping
- Well, the research would suggest that as a fraction of your income, you will spend more money online than I would for goods. So say for example, Eric's wearing a nice pair of jeans. If he was shopping in a small town, there might be one or two stores that carry big brands like Levi's. And if you wanted more variety, you would go to Jeans.com and buy your jeans. If I’m in Philly or New York City, and there's just a ton of stores selling jeans, I have less need for the online option. So proportionately, you will spend on goods more money online than I would. That's what the research would suggest. 
- Conversely, for information, I'm more likely to get out my phone and start looking for concerts, restaurants, movie and things to do. Because I'm in New York City or Philadelphia, than you are here, because there's just more stuff going on. 
- 
- So the digital world becomes a complement in information, and becomes a substitute for goods and services, if you're in a small town.
So if you go to China for example, people in Beijing and Shanghai, are on average wealthier than people in third and fourth-tier cities. So they'll spend more money overall. But as a fraction of income, people in third and fourth-tier cities, will spend more online, purely because they just don't have access. So I think when you see this concentration towards cities, you might see more information services. Because people in cities need information to navigate those cities. And you might see greater total amount of money online. But in the small towns, you'll see a greater proportion. So those are the two effects.

#### 3.3.2.5. adjacency and topography
- the concept of adjacency is the concept that when things are close, they influence each other. And they're also sort of more likely to be the same. And by things in this case, let's focus on people or neighbors. So if you think about the people, for the learners out there, who live in your immediate local neighborhood, on average They'll be more similar to you in terms of their characteristics, the preferences that they like. And most critically, the options that they have to buy things and do things than someone who's randomly taken from another part of the country.
- The second thing about adjacency is if you and I live physically close, in the same apartment in New York City, and you order your razors from Dollar Shave Club. And I happen to come home, I might see that box, or i might see you wearing a pair of Warby Parker glasses. So there could be physical transmission of information, either because we talk to each other, or we just happen to observe each other.
- when you look at the way a digital company builds its demand, they could build the demand throughout an entire analog space. So throughout the entire United States I could be selling stuff. But I tend to sell it in clusters, and I've got customers here in this location. In the future, I'm more likely to get additional customers in the same location because of this adjacency effect, which is both similarity and actual sort of influence, if you will. 

- *homophily*
So because of the type of person I am, because of the offline options that I have, and because of my preferences, because my neighbor is not a clone of me, but similar to me. This is the concept the learners, the technical term is called homophily. And the more informal term is, the birds of a feather flock together. So because of that, we will see on average, a second customer in that location, before a customer somewhere else.
What we've found in some of our research is, it'll take hold in a hot spot, and then it'll expand around that hot spot like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego. And then once there's a certain saturation reached, then it will start to move to smaller locations, that are physically further apart from each other, but that also share characteristics.
##### 3.3.2.5.1. decisions that a firm could take to maximize this geographic, the power of adjacency
- the first practical thing you want to do is to think about the locations in which you're most likely to have good early customers. And to really double down and to seed those locations, with local advertising, local influences, and so on, that's the first thing. 
- The second thing you really want to do is that the packaging of the product becomes now very, very important. What it looks like, what kind of box is it, because that's also a form of advertising. Both with people unboxing, as the learners know, unboxing videos. But also if I order, for example, as I did, a mattress from a company called casper.com, and it comes in a big blue and white box. I mean, that box now is going to be potentially visible to my local neighbors. So if you want to leverage adjacency, think about how you can get the product to speak for itself through packaging and other means, once you've dropped it, or seeded it.

##### 3.3.2.5.2. Topografy
Landscape
now we're living in this world that's both analog and digital at the same time. So if we take a very, very simple concept, thinking about retail, 100 years ago when we bought our products, we would examine them in an analog world, in a store. And we'd also buy them and fulfill them and take them away in an analog store. And then there became maybe 1994, 1995, the Internet came along and there websites like, let's say jeans.com, I'm just making this up. Where you could get the information in the digital world, and you could complete the purchase of the digital world, and the product would be shipped to you. So those were the two elements. And now, of course, we have these mixed combinations, where you could go into, let's take a famous example, a Tesla showroom. I currently don't own a car, but you could go into a Tesla, the automobile. They don't actually have cars that you can buy and take away, but you can look and touch and feel them in a small high experience environment. And then the product will be delivered to you.Or conversely, in the other quadrant, you could have a traditional retailer that's been around for 50 years, lets say Sephora, that sells makeup. And you could engage customers online with information, and then you could bring them into the physical store for fulfillment. 

So by topography, I just mean this landscape that certain activities, as a firm you want to do online, and other ones you still want to do offline. And getting that mix correct in this landscape is one of the biggest challenges,

 think most firms, again, it depends a little on what you're selling. May want to play in almost all of those spaces where you're offering products or services and information both online and offline. 
 
 - So there's sort of, two advantages to having a physical location. One is, the customer can have a great experience of the brand. They can really get to know you, really getting engaged. And my researchers are finding actually, that If you come into a store like the Warby Parker or Bonobos, that's a men's clothing company. And there's no product to take away, but you touch and feel it, when you subsequently buy online you're more likely to buy a wider variety of products. Well, I actually talk about this now, similar today here in Illinois, you get more exposure to the brand, so you become a better customer. 
 - The second reason I think is fascinating, I'm going to borrow a quote from a colleague at Harvard, John Deighton, a very nice fellow that Eric and I both know. So in the old economy, if Eric and I both have a store here in Illinois, and 100 people come to the store, at the end of the day, 100 people have learned something about our store, maybe 110. Ten people have told their wife or husband or something. In the digital economy, maybe 10,000 people learned about what happened in our store, because some lady that came in has 5,000 followers on Instagram. So because your audience has an audience, your customer potentially can be a megaphone. So if you have a place where cool stuff is happening, it's not only the people that came there, it's greatly amplified digitally. So that's another really important value proposition of having some kind of analog space.

```

ompanies who've adopted the same model of building a value product starting digital and then going analogue.

```ad-example
title: So for the learners, this is a fascinating phenomenon, the idea of a pop-up store or a movable store. So Warby Parker, because of the name coming from a book in a library in a school, you kind of see a palette that's emerging in terms of the story. They took a very iconic product. Those are the learners who've come to the United States. Or even if you're somewhere else, you watch movies, you see the iconic yellow school bus. So they took one of these buses, and they started something called the Warby Parker class trip. And this bus drove all around America. And it would stop in a certain location. And of course, they would, in the digital world, announce where the bus was, people would show up, they would have this experience. And we found in our research, Eric, actually, after the bus stopped in Illinois, digital sales increased in places where the bus was going around
```



#### 3.3.2.6. maximize the synergy between the analog and the digital?
The first thing, if you're trying to sell a product or a service, is to think about the physical locations of the customers who might be most receptive. That would be number one. So where would these people physically reside?
Then number two, think about what could be done in those physical locations to amplify, or improve, or rapidly expand the sales process.
And then number three, as your idea advances, start to think about so what part of the business should I really digitalize? And what part of it should we really have analog? 

What I have seen, actually, is that companies that started in the analogue world, on average, have a more difficult job transitioning in the digital. Whereas, I think, companies that have started digitally, For some reason, it seems to be easier to start digital and add analog than to be analog first and to add digital. At least, that's my anecdotal experience.

## 4.1. Basic Concept: Analog Transformation
a transformation occurs when something exhibits a dramatic change in either form and/or function due to some driving force.

Thus, when we look at analog transformation, we'll be focusing on products or services that are still analog in nature but are being transformed by the driving force of the digital revolution.

in addition to creating new combinations, the digital can be added to or subtracted from the analog in such a way that the analog product or service is transformed into a different form or function. 
## 4.2. Embracing
by adding the digital, the analog can be transformed. We call this embracing
we define embracing as a change in the form and/or function of analog product (or service) that occurs when it's combined with the digital. 
Typically, embracing transforms analog product or service by combining the benefits of tangibility or sociability with the digital benefits of affordability or visibility.

1. The outsider perspective
The idea came from an outsider. Someone who didn't create the initial analog product or service. Outsiders often have the benefit of seeing new possibilities because their vision is less likely to be constrained by what academics call *functional fixedness*. In other words, outsiders are better able to think of new uses for old things.
2. Low cost of entry
- typically benefits from low entry cost because in most cases, the analog product or service already exist
3. easily copied
 In most cases, the transformations that occur via embracing change only some of the products or services in different category. Thus, those are not part of initial integration strategy can be used by competitors to adopt a copycat strategy.
### 4.2.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 4.2.1.1. Form versus Function
As we discussed earlier, embracing changes the form and/or function of an analog product or service. Thus, if you're considering employing, embracing as a strategy, you think about what form or function should be transformed. For example, Uber is really a change of function while Coursera is a change of form. When considering your various options there are two key questions that keep in mind:
1. how easy would it be to make this transformation?
2. what value does this transformation provide?
Ideally, you want to select transformations that are fairly easy to implement, but that would provide a high degree of value to your potential customers. 

#### 4.2.1.2. Outsource the Content
One of the challenges of embracing, much like any digital business model, is having to come up with fresh content. In the digital environment content is king and developing this content can be extremely costly process if you have to do it internally. Thus, many successful digital businesses such as Apple, Facebook, and YouTube outsource much or nearly all of their content to developers outside of the company. This outsourcing approach has a dual benefit of both lowering the cost of creation while also forging closer customer connections to your product offering.

#### 4.2.1.3. Refresh the Analog
Because it is being transformed, the analog product or service that serves as the foundation for it to embrace your strategy is likely to be used in ways that wasn't intended. Thus, it may need to be refreshed to make it more suitable for this new purpose. 

#### 4.2.1.4. get ready for challengers
Because the entry barriers are low once a new business transforms an analog product via embracing, others are likely to follow. 
- be ready for copycats to follow.
Since it will be hard to stop competitors from entering the market, the best way of defending your business will be to limit their reach. You can best do this by trying to scale your business as quickly as possible and getting as much attention as many initial customers as you can. encouraging your customers to broadcast your product or service on social media is also a good way defend against challengers.

## 4.3. Distancing
 the analog can also be transformed when it subtracts the digital
 define distancing as a change in the form or function of an Analog product or a service that occurs when it is removed from the Digital.
 
 
 
 Thus, these flip phones are growing in popularity not because of the features they offer but due to the features, essentially no Internet connection, that they don't offer. This is a great example of how distancing from the digital can transform a product. In essence, through this distancing approach, both the form and the function of the phone is transformed. From a pocket computer that can do just about anything, to a basic communication device that only does a few things.
 
 
 Typically, distancing transforms an analog product or service by subtracting some of its digital benefits - addition by subtracting
 
  while digital features such as visibility or trackability may provide some benefits when employed in moderation. A growing number of people are becoming concerned that these features may also lead to negative consequences, such as lack of privacy, identify theft. And even bullying, as the result, many people are seeking analog experiences that avoid these negative consequences of our digital world.
  


1. Niche appeal
distancing is more of a niche strategy and may not appeal to most people most of the time. However, it can still be a very profitable approach if it targets the right niche. 
2. The Heart of the Beast.
 a distancing strategy has the most appeal among those who are the most digitally connected.  distancing is more likely to appeal to people who are younger, more affluent, and engaged in professional jobs
3. More Sizzle than Steak
 a distancing strategy may be more hype than reality. good marketing is not just about the actual features of a product but how these features are perceived by the customer.
 
 
### 4.3.1. Practical reccomendation
#### 4.3.1.1. turn off the net
 most distancing strategies are pretty simple. At their core, most include turning off access to the Internet.
```ad-example
title: digital detox camps
Camp Grounded is a digital detox summer camp in California that forces campers to distance themselves from the digital by banning smart phones, tablets, and computers. Instead, the focus is on establishing face to face interactions, and campers participate in traditional analog activities such as meditation, yoga, and hiking. If you think that these types of camps sound a lot like the types of camps that you attended as a kid, you are right. In essence, by distancing from the digital, the traditional summer camp for kids has been transformed in its function, and has become an escape for adults in need of a detox from the digital. Indeed, we live in a digital age and it's very difficult if not impossible for most of us to escape this reality. Thus, attending a digital detox camp for a week or ditching your smartphone or a flip phone may make you more aware of the pros and cons of the digital world. However, it's unlikely to transform your life. Hence, these strategies are essentially more sizzle than steak. Likewise, the main difference between a digital detox camp and a regular camp is a lack of digital connectivity. Typically taking something away is fairly cheap and easy. Indeed, by not having Wi-Fi access both flip phones and digital detox camps reduce their cost. This allows them to either charge a lower price and or enjoy higher profits. Thus, a distancing strategy is fairly easy to implement a product offering perspective and can be quite attractive from a pricing perspective. A good example of this is tech free schools which claim that digital devices hamper creativity, decrease physical activity and limit human interaction. As we discussed earlier, there is considerable evidence that too much time spent in the digital world can be harmful to our well-being. 
```

#### 4.3.1.2. don't distance your marketing
So even though you may be marketing a product or service to help people distance themselves from the digital, you should still use digital tools to help them find you and get them to choose you. Indeed, distancing strategies are likely to have the most appeal to those who are most heavily engaged and embedded in the digital world.


#### 4.3.1.3. target millennials
Overall, too much time spent in the digital world has been linked to depression, narcissism, and a decrease attention span. As a result, a growing number of people especially young people appear to be growing tired of the digital. This trend has been called *Digital fatigue*. 

For digital natives such as millennials who grew up in an online environment, the digital world is not as exciting or as revolutionary as it is for digital immigrants such as the baby boomers. In fact, for many young people the digital world is becoming boring and a growing number of them are disconnecting from social media. Hence, millennials is going to be a great target market for transforming the digital by using a distancing strategy. 

#### 4.3.1.4. employ FUD
many marketing campaigns are based on appealing to Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.
a FUD strategy can be used to encourage consumers to consider products and services that allow them to distance themselves from the dangers of the digital. Thus, distancing strategies can leverage this growing awareness of the hazards of the digital as an effective marketing approach.

 consumer brand sabotage. >> What it means is it's an activity whereby consumers actively trying to damage the brand. And the key objective is to harm the brand. These are consumers who have exhausted all other means. They may have contacted the company or that, but they're just not satisfied with the response from the company. And so they've decided they don't want a relationship with the company anymore and they want to punish the brand. They really want to harm the brand.
 
2 tupes:
##### 4.3.1.5.1. performance based sabotage
is because something was not satisfactory with the company. They didn't meet expectations for the brand. 
 digital is transforming analog company's because in the old days, in an analog world, company had complete control over the brand and the brand image. So everything was carefully planned in terms of what the advertising is going to say, what the message is, how the brand is going to be positioned. All that was 100% controlled by the brand manager. Today, in the digital environment, we've lost control. We have some control, but consumers don't make a distinction between what advertisement they seen an analog world versus a message they see on Facebook or see anywhere online and that the sum total of all communications is the brand image. And so consumers participate in creating the brand image. And sometimes that can be bad. Like we see with the brand sabotage, sometimes it can be really good as well.
 the key thing is how digital is transforming is that consumers now participate in creating the brand image. And we have to recognize that as marketers and try to manage that process, we can't control it, but we can try to manage it.
 
###### 4.3.1.5.1.1. What can a firm or a manager do using digital tools to either minimize this risk or respond to it once it occurs. 
 One thing to minimize risk, what we found in our research on brand sabotage is that there are certain key emotions that consumers have and hate is the biggest one that they hate the brand and that causes them to want to harm the brand. And what marketers can do now is monitor social media to look at the conversations that consumers are having.
 
###### 4.3.1.5.1.2. Digital transformation
 Well, the big thing, particularly for this generation, the new generation of students we're not going to be in 10 years talking about the difference between analog and digital anymore. It's all going to become seamless and it's going to be integrated into just one experience. We will be online all the time and we're already in many cases online, but that will be frequent. We won't be carrying cell phones anymore. We can be digitally online just through like a microchip technology they're talking about behind the year, for example. And so it's going to be a lot more seamless and we're not just not going to make a different differentiation. So we need to always be thinking digitally. 
 
###### 4.3.1.5.1.3. Much more personalized messages.
 One in the analog world, we had the world of mass communications large like Super Bowl ads and things of this nature. And the model was very much what I would call a one way form of communication. The company come on putting out their message to a large segment of consumers. 
 - Today's digital world. It's more of a two way communication where companies are constantly having conversations with their customers. 
 - *reciprocity*
	 - So in the whole world we try to convince you, I would try to persuade you to do something whereas now in a more digital environment it's more of, if you do something for me, I'll do something for you. And so we have to be more concerned about consumer needs and why would they want to spend time with us? So we got to get them to want to pay attention to our brand rather than force them to have the brand. 
	 -  It's more interpersonal communication and those communications can't be more persuasive messages. They need to be more helping consumers solve their problems. 
###### 4.3.1.5.1.4. privacy
 Because if we're always online, we can be monitored and so there needs to be some kind of controls to to make sure that that is not abused, that we're not. And these discussions are already being held. This is something new, but it has become more digital.
