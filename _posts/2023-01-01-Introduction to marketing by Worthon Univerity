#### 1.1.1.2. Sellers' Market
##### 1.1.1.2.1. How seller's market is different from buyer's market?
```ad-question
title: What is the difference between sellers market, customer-based market?                
collapse: open 
- In a sellers market you focus on the product, on what the company does well, and push that out. 
- In a customer-based market, you focus on the customer, what the customer wants, and you deliver value to the customer better than the competition.
```

##### 1.1.1.2.2. What are the characteristics of a sellers' market?
```ad-question
title: What are the characteristics of a sellers' market?
collapse: open 
- the seller has a product, and if you want that product, you have to come to the seller. So the seller has all the power
- Production: Focuson the company
- Product focused marketing
```
```ad-question
title: What it means to be product-focus?
- You (the seller) have the product. If the customers want it, they're going to come to you. In that case, you should **develop that product** to the best of your ability, **innovate** and try to **reduce cost** and you really *focus on the product* and try to sell as much as you can.
```
```ad-question
title: What is the business objective?
profitability
```

##### 1.1.1.2.3. Where does profitabilty comes from?
```ad-warning
title: Profitability is tied to: 
- market share
- amount of sales
- volume
```

```ad-question
title: Why does market share increase profitability?
Higher revenues & lower cost = more profit
!!! ad-question
    title: Why?
    Because the bigger your market share, the bigger your revenue; and the bigger your market share and volume, the lower the product cost and hance *profitability*. [[theaory of scale]]?
```

##### 1.1.1.2.4. Where does growth gome from, in a seller's market?

```ad-question
title: In a product focused  market and when you're product focused, where do you get growth? 
- you develop new products based on your product experience
OR
- you go to new markets
 <div class="signature"> - Ansoff Matrix </div> 
```


```ad-info
title:  To sum up                
In a product-focused marketing
- we sell as much as we can and we sold that product to anybody who wanted that product.

In the customer-focused market
- we choose which customers to serve and which not.
```

#### 1.1.1.3. Buyer Market
##### 1.1.1.3.1. What are the characteristics of a buyer's market
```ad-question
title: What are the characteristics of a buyers market?
- Market where there's lots of competition, a lot of products out there, and the power is in the buyer
- Marketing: Focus on customer and competition
```

##### 1.1.1.3.2. What is Customer-focused marketing?

```ad-question
title: what is Customer-focused marketing?
Customer-focused marketing means that I need to focus on the customer to get that customer to buy from me rather than the competition.
!!! ad-question
    title:  what's the best way to get the customer to buy from you rather than from the competition?
    The best way to do it, is to **look at what that customer wants, and deliver a product that meets the needs of that customer better than the competition**. 
```

##### 1.1.1.3.3. Is it different from product-focused marketing?

```ad-question
title: How procuct-focused marketing is different from customer-focused marketing? 
- inside-out = product-focused marketing, product/production orientation, producttion approach
    - I'm the expert and based on my expertise I create the very best product my resources allow me.
        - Company-focused, marketing myopia
- outside-in = customer-focused markeitng, customer orientation, marketing approach
	- I'm interested in what the customer wants, and try to create product to meet that customer's need.	
```
```ad-question
title: What is the strategy of product-focused marketing? 
To create the best possible product, so that the customer buys it
```



```ad-question
title: What is the strategy of customer-focused markeitng?
**Listen to what the customer wants and then create a product that suites them better than the competition!**

```

```ad-question
title: How to deliver value to that customer?
- Look at what the  customer wants [[Customer analytics]]
  - What does the customer want? 
	- which customer, exactly?
	- Who is the customer? 
```

```ad-warning
title: You can't give every customer what they want, and we know customers are going to want all different things.           
The buyer's market (customer-focused marketing) is more different than product focus, because ==every customer out there, wants something different== and if we try to give everybody what they want, we'll go out of business and is too hard to do. 

!!! ad-question
    title: So what should I do?
    **Segmentation** 
    1. Be selective when choosing customers.
    2. Deliver value to some customers and say no to other customers. 
```

##### 1.1.1.3.4. Where does profitability come from with customer-focused marketing
```ad-question
title:  Well, then, how do I become profitable with customer-focused marketing?          
-  The profitability comes from **creating value** (*not volume*).
1. You pick and choose the customers you want to deliver to.
2. You deliver value to that customer, give them exactly what they want at a price they're willing to pay. 
```

```ad-question
title: How can value-based marketing be profitable?
1. Serving what they want at an **increased price premium**
  - If you give me exactly what I want, I'll be more willing to pay a higher price for it. 
  - If I give you exactly what you want, many times, you'd be willing to pay a premium price. Then the profitability comes in *not from reduced cost* (which we saw in the seller market), but from **increased price premium**.
2. building customer loyalty and customer share
- *I don't think about just one transaction* (==market share==), I think about **building customer loyalty**, and always delivering the promised value to that customer. That concept is called ==customer share==.
```

```ad-question
title: How is customer share different from market share?
- market share = I try to get a little bit from everybody "Get a few from many"
- customer share (share of wallet) = I go after a more narrow market and try to get more from each of those customer's wallets. "get many from a few"
```

```ad-warning
title: So customer loyalty can be very profitable, great!
Not so fast... customer loyalty can be very profitable,  **if done the right way**. 
```

##### 1.1.1.3.5. Why is customer-centricity more profitable?
```ad-question
title: Considering that customer loyalty reqires upfront investment for giving the customer exactly what they want and it is more difficult and more expensive to acquire new customers, what makes customer loyalty more profitable?
> it's cheaper to retain those customers over time
```
```ad-question
title: Why it's cheaper to retain those customers over time?
Because **it's cheaper to repeatedly deliver it to them**.
After I figure out what that customer wants and deliver it once. The original product might require updates, amendments and improvements, so it is *vital* to listen and collect feedback from customers.
```

##### 1.1.1.3.6. How to build share of wallet in the customer-focused market?
###### 1.1.1.3.6.1. Cross-selling
```ad-question
title: Cross-selling
- same market, new product
    - meaning, the cost per aquisition is going to decrease and more budget will be allocated towards Reasearch & Development. Which might increase customers' purchase order as they will beprovided more produts to choose from
        - cross-selling
        - up-selling
```
```ad-question
title: what is cross-selling?
When I not only sell one product to you, but think about other things that you might need and I try to cross-sell around it.
!!! ad-example
    title: cross-selling example
    If you've ever gone into a GAP or some jeans store, and, and you go to the cash register and you buy a pair of jeans. The, the cashier or that person behind the counter might say: Oh these are very nice jeans. Do you think you'll need a belt with that? Do you think you'll need socks? That's the notion of cross selling. So I'm selling other things to you besides that one specific product.
```

```ad-tip
title: *Increasing customer share* is a very important part of customer focused marketing:           
**Give the customer exactly what they want** and *they'll be willing to pay a premium price for it*. **Keep delivering value over time** and *they will stay loyal to you, and buy over time*. 

This is more profitabile, because if you understand their needs, you can not only *sell them one product*, but you can **cross-sell other products that may also meet their needs**. 
```

```ad-tip
title: In a customer-based market profitability comes from ==premium price, loyalty, and cross selling==
collapse: close
```


#### 1.1.1.4. Connected community
```ad-question
title: What is the deep focus of *experience orientation* ?
customer experiential value
```

##### 1.1.1.4.1. Globalization:
###### 1.1.1.4.1.1. What has changed?
```ad-warning
title: Well now not only do you have an exchange between buyers and sellers, but because of **globalization** and *the Internet, technology and social media* and things like that, **it's not a one to one conversation anymore** - ==customers can talk to each other==. 
collapse: close
```
```ad-warning
title: That's good and bad 
\+ Good: if you're doing a really good job and meeting the needs of the customers, the fact that they'll buzz to their other customers and tell their friends about what a terrific service your company is doing.
\- Bad : if something goes wrong and they tell their friends about it. 
```
```ad-warning
title: you have to be really *careful in every transaction with the customer*
- Because now you deliver value and *a top notch customer experience*.
 ```
 

 
 
| seller's market      | buyer's market         | connected community            |                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |-------                         |
| a single transaction | transactions over time | the entire customer experience | The focus is on                               |

##### 1.1.1.4.2. From transaction-orientation to customer experience orientation
```ad-tip
title: Both the seller's market (a single transaction) and in the buyer's market (transactions over time) the focus is on transactions. In a connected community, if your message is being shared by customers to other customers, they talk about the customer experience.
collapse: close
```

###### 1.1.1.4.2.1. What do I mean by customer experience?
```ad-warning
title: The experience starts way before the transaction, and it goes way after the transaction. 
collapse: close
```
```ad-example
title: The customers might describe their experience:
So if a customer told another customer that their experience at a restaurant. They might say, well I was driving to that restaurant and I hit a lot of traffic, then I got to the parking lot and I couldn't find a parking space. Finally when I got into the restaurant, I got a table, the meal was really good, but then at the end of the meal when I was leaving I tripped and fell.
```
```ad-tip
title: What should the marketer do?
The marketer has to be **completely transparent, authentic and focus on the entire customer experience**.
```

#### 1.1.1.5. Past reccession and economic uncertanty 
```ad-question
title: What did this economic uncertanty lead to?
- skandals
- marketing scepticism
- lost of trust
- marketing had bad names
```
##### 1.1.1.5.1. What is the focus of the trust orientation?
```ad-warning
title: Genuine customer value: respect, discipline and flexibility
collapse: close
```
```ad-question
title: How to do it?
**Deliver customer value over time** *in an experiential way*, **be flexible and respectable to changes in the market place** (lower price when needed).

title: 1.Principle of customer value
- To get a custoemr to buy from you rather than the competition, you have to give them real, genuine customer value
```

- Give the customer what they want, in a better than the competition (and for the custoemer) way
```
```ad-warning
title: 3.Principle of Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning

#### 1.1.2.2. The 4Ps are the tools that deliver the offering:
``````ad-question
title: What are the 4Ps?
```ad-warning
title: Product
- is what the seller puts into the exchange
```
```ad-warning
title: Place (Distribution)
- the way the seller delivers the product
```

### 1.1.3. Data-Driven Business Models
### 1.1.4. Three Cheers for Direct Marketing
```ad-warning
title: Three Cheers
!!! ad-list
    title: Building the business around each and every customer
    - The individual customer is the unit of analysis
 
!!! ad-list
    title: Understanding the relationship with each customer
    - Who has bought what from us, for how much
    - What kind of products have they inquired about and returned
    - what interaction have they had with customer service

!!! ad-list
    title: Having much richer relationship between the company and the customer
    - Aim to determine marketing communication based on past purchase.
```

```ad-warning
title: It is not enough to be customer-centric some of the time
!!! ad-success
    title: A truly customer centric company will identify you and will be able to value you and make recommendations no matter what kinds of interactions you have with them. Whether you go from store to store, whether you go online or offline. 
```

```ad-question
title: What so many companies strugge with?
Maintain a balance between focusing on both the product and the customer that 
```

```ad-question
title: When would it make sense to give someone money back for a product that they couldn't have possibly bought from you? 
!!! ad-success
    title: If that customer has  sufficiently high future value (CLV) to you
    !!! ad-question
        title: What do you mean?
        - We expect this customer to be buying so much from us in the future that if we don't give them money back now, we're going to lose that value. 
    !!! ad-fail
        title: If it's not, we would politely decline.
        - And for most customers it wouldn't be
        - We might still be nice to you, of course, but we're not going to give you money back if we don't see the value in it.
```


### 1.1.5. What is Customer Centricity?

```ad-question
title: What is Customer Centricity?
Customer centricity is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services around the current and the future need of a select set of customers in order to maximize their long-term financial value to the firm.
!!! ad-success
    title: Customer centricity requires us to **look ahead**, figure out **who the valuable customers will be** and **do things for them** to **help them recognize that we have their best interests in mind**. 
```
```ad-warning
title: There are some fireable offences!
!!! ad-warning
	title: select set of customers
	The whole idea of having and emphasizing a select set of customers, very much runs against the grain of, of many businesses.
		- In the product-centric world, you can't have a select set of customers, because we're so dependent on generating as much volume as possible, on the selling as much stuff as we can, that we can't really afford to be selective. It is what keeps our costs down.
		- It's going to be hard to keep our costs down if we're selective.
!!! ad-warning
	title: maximize their long-term financial value
	In most situations it's hard for a company to do that. Given the pressures of Wall Street, and just the conventional ways we look at business. We're so short-term oriented, we got to the hit the quarterly numbers.
	!!! ad-success
		title: The long run profits that we can get from customers can be greater than just trying to get them to buy another thing right now.
		We want to invest in the right customers. We're willing to recommend products and services that we're not going to make any money off of.
!!! ad-warning
	title: alighn a company's R&D around our customers
	Putting these valuable customers front and center
	!!! ad-fail
		title: R&D folks what's the next big thing that you have for us?
		 come up with the next big thing for us
		You've been so good at, at coming up with these terrific products and services.
	!!! ad-success
		title: R&D folks come up with something for them
		Here we're saying, hey R and D guys and gals, here are really valuable customers over here, let's come up with something for them, something that's going to make them even more locked in, something that's going to create greater long-run value for them, and something that's going to help us recruit even more customers like them.
```
```ad-question
title: What are the challenges and opportunities
    Customer centricity requires the company to be willing and able to change its orientational design, performance metrics and employee (distributor incentive structures) to focus on this long-run value creation-delivery process.
!!! ad-warning
	title: Be future looking
	!!! ad-question
		title: How a salesperson of the month incentive should work?
		I want a company to calculate the lifetime value of each and every customer at the beginning and end of the month/quarter.
		Then let's ask ourselves, *not just how much stuff we sold to the customer*, **but how much did we elevate their lifetime value?**
		!!! ad-success
			title: So instead of us going to customers who are going to buy things anyway, let's try to build relationships with customers.
			Maybe they weren't inclined to buy
			Maybe they didn't, by the end of the month
			But we're closer to making this sale.
			We've improved the relationship.
			We've lengthened and maybe deepened the relationship.
			!!! ad-success
				title: In the long run we will create much more value that wouldn't have been there.
				Instead of just rewarding them based on what they've done, you want to encourage them to build relationships.
				You don't want to just close sales, you want to build long lasting relationships, you want them to invest in the customers, even if they're not getting anything out of it right away.        
```
it's the way, just changes the conversation, and perhaps the design, within the organization.

### 1.1.6. Living in a Customer - Centric World

```ad-question
title: What is the overarching objective for a customer-centric commercial enterprise?
- The goal of the firm is to maximize sharehlder value in the short run and the long run, recognizing the time value of money.
- Customer centricity is a different way of achieving the same goal, but it's a path that actually might help you get there faster and better.

```

```ad-question
title: How do we achieve it?
- customer heterogeneity: distinguish the profitable customer from less profitable ones
!!! ad-question
	title: Which customers will be more valuable?
	- Focus on future profitability (Customer Livetime Value) rather than past profits.
```

```ad-question
title: What are the key tactics that drive profitability in a customer centric world? Success aires through enhanced (and/or more efficientt):

- customer acuisition
    - Which kinds of customers should we be acquiring? How much should we be willing to spend to acquire them.?
- customer retention
    - Should we try to keep everybody, should we roll out the red carpet for everyone, or should we be a little bit more selective
- customer development
    - Are there some customers who we can make into better customers than others. And how do those tactics tie in with the acquisition and the retention? 
- Customer-centric organizational structure
	- Ideally, the whole org chart would be built around the different kinds of customers we have. And then below them, the different ways that we're going to create and extract the profits from them.


```


The competitive advantage is "relationship experience" with respect to focal customers.

![](attachment\b374527e3de173d67d5deb090e201b51.png)
It's conversion thinking. How do we bring more value to this customers? What products and services can we develop? What information can we provide? What can we do in the relationship to create and extract more value, more value for these really valuable customers?

```ad-warning
title: Customer centricity does *NOT* suggest that non-focal customers should be ignored/fired:
- to the contrary, it is important to have a healthy proportion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base.
-  we're not going to let those so-so customers drive the business. We're going to continue to focus on the customer-centric ones for growth. We're going to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of our R&D activity on those really good customers, coming up with products for them, hoping and finding ways to make those same products palatable and attractive for the product-centric customers. But it's a matter of finding that balance.
```

#### 1.1.6.1. Discussion questions

```ad-question
title: Who is the customer?
- Is it the end consumer, who's buying and using the product?
- Can your organization come up with a single,consensus answer to this question, or can you at least reconcile the roles/relationships of the different potentialcustomers?
    - Agreeing, that one of these entities is the customer, we care a lot about the others, we need to keep them in mind, as we go through our planning practices. But, but, one kind of customer matters more than others.
```

```ad-question
title: What are the major barriers to account for? 
- Develop a comprehensive list, ranked by the importance/difficulty of each barrier.
```

```ad-question
title: What resources can you utilize to overcome these barriers?
- Very often, the resources are going to be financial. You're going to have to invest money, to build the information technology systems and to hire employees, and to start developing a data infrastructure. Sometimes, they're going to be cultural, we're going to have to hire the right kind of people, who can think around, conversion thinking around the customer, instead of diversion thinking around the product. So, there's a, a number of, of, of different ways that we can start thinking in advance, about overcoming the barriers, before the, the barriers actually start impeding our progress.
```


```ad-question
title: What the competitors are doing in this area?
-  Hey, they're moving towards customer centricity, we should be doing it, too.
-  In many cases, the best motivations to move towards customer centricity, it's the entire opposite of that, hey no one's doing it, let's be the first. ometimes, being the only one doing the customer centric thing, is the way to make it most successful.
```

```ad-question
title: Does it make sense for your organization to become customer centric?
- If so, what should be your immediate goals and medium-term expectations?

###### 1.1.6.1.1.1. Barriers to, and Challenge of, Customer Centricity
 How do we organize ourselves around our valued customers? And how do we sort out the not so valuable from the valuable and find balance within the organization? Things like talent management. So how do we go about finding people who can really do that kind of convergent thinking, in order to figure out how to surround those valuable customers with the right kinds of products and services to enhance their value and so on. Things like branding.
 how do we come up with brands that resonate in all the ways that Barbara talks about it but at the same time, does justice to customer centricity? There's unique challenges there in terms of the name that we choose and the different kinds of communication tactics that we use. 
 how do we find that just right balance between the kind of direct marketing activities that we associate with customers centricity and the more product oriented activities that we often associate with a brand or a different strategy? How about globalization? Given that the different parts of the world are more open to customer-centric practices, how can a multi-national firm be customer-centric in some parts of the world, maybe be a little bit more product-centric in others. So how do you find that balance? How can you have a coherent strategy when there might be some global barriers that prevent you from using the same kind of customer centricity, product centricity balance all the way across the globe? How about non-financial objectives? I mentioned that towards the beginning of my session, that the overall objective is to maximize shareholder value. And while that might be the primary objective, there's also some other objectives that we really should acknowledge. Like, what about our employees? What about the communities in which we operate? So, how do we think through some of those other objectives and kind of keep them in mind? And try to find ways to use customer centricity to enhance how well we're doing on those dimensions as well? How about channel relationships? I mean there's a real interesting challenge. That if we're going to be using some parts of our sales force to surround those valuable customers, to enhance value, and do all that kind of thing. That we're going to be doing kind of lower cost channel activities for those so so customers. So how do we incent our channel partners to want to play along? For those channel partners who are dealing with the lower end, how do we keep them from getting upset? And how do we use monetary incentives or other kinds of incentives to make them realize that they still play a really important part of the business, even if they're not necessarily dealing with the very best customers? How about performance metrics? So we understand that there's very different kinds of performance metrics for a product-centric company versus a customer-centric one. How do we come up with and communicate the right kinds of performance metrics both internally, to our internal stakeholders, as well as externally? How do we get wall street on board with some of the more customer-oriented metrics, that their not accustomed to using, that might be a better indicator of just how well we're doing as a company? And then last, but by no means least, how about corporate culture? It's a very different vibe that you're going to see inside an organization that customer customer-centric versus product-centric. I like to say over and over and over, it's not enough to just hang a banner on the lunch room walls saying we are now customer-centric. Changing the culture within the organization is something that's very difficult. It takes a long time to do, and a lot of companies are resistant to do it because it's a very risky thing to do as well. But you can't really succeed with customer centricity unless you want to take that one on. 
###### 1.1.6.1.1.2. Pay It Forward: Google and Others

title: So in many cases the idea of customer centricity isn't necessarily something that you do with your own customers, or it's not something that you do only with your customers. But in a B to B setting you are also going to teach your customers how to do these things with their customers. Pay it forward.
```

###### 1.1.6.1.1.3. CLV: Electronic Arts
So why don't we look at our customers? Let's look at the game players and try to figure out, who are the most valuable players we have out there? What kind of games do they like? And can we use that insight to help us develop new games? So in other words, we're really making it customer driven instead of purely product driven.  they're terrific on the creative side and coming up with games. But they're equally terrific when it comes to a lot of the customer oriented metrics and insights that I've been talking about, or at least hinting at in our time together. So for instance, I mentioned lots of time, customer lifetime value. And for a lot of companies, I'm saying, you gotta do it, you gotta do it. And for a lot of companies, it tends to be a barrier. Well, Electronic Arts is calculating customer lifetime value all the time. And in fact, they're updating those CLE estimates on a regular basis so they can understand who those best customers are. So they can understand what kinds of acquisition strategies are going to bring in the best kinds of customers. So they can understand what kinds of games or features within games are going to be most appealing to the most valuable customers. So I don't want to say it's completely transformed the organization. I don't want to say that they've given up on any product-centeric practises at all. That wouldn't be be true. But they're achieving just a much nicer balance. They're doing a lot of the customer-centric things to either inform, or clarify, or supplement a lot of the product oriented things that they're doing.
###### 1.1.6.1.1.4. Rewarding CLV: Merial
Instead, let's give sales people the incentive in a forward looking basis. So we're calculate our CLV for every one of our customers, and add that up to say, for the level of our sales people or our distributors, how much CLV have they created or destroyed from one month to the next? And we're going to reward you, we're going to give you the bonuses on the basis of this future-looking value that you've created. So that if someone makes a purchase from you, great! Their CLV goes up, that's terrific. But what if someone just kind of took your call or what if someone responded to a direct mail piece? What if someone showed up at a trade show? They didn't necessarily make a purchase. We didn't necessarily extract any dollars out of them right now, but because the relationship is a little bit tighter, because there's a real conversation going on, their CLV has gone up. And we should reward the sales person for making that possible. So they did this and it took a long time because at first they did it on an experimental basis. Let's calculate those CLVs. Let's see if they go up. Let's reward people accordingly. Let's allocate our resources to focus on those customers who would be the best ones for us. At first, the sales people, the distributors, they kind of look at it skeptically and say oh, it's just those guys in marketing trying something crazy. Not sure it's going to work. But they ran this as an experiment over a period of several years to really show the sales folks that you know what, we really are helping you identify customers who have future looking value in them. And look, that value has unlocked itself, so you really should trust us. So, they completely revamped their sales force using this forward looking CLV metric, instead of the backward looking profitability metric, and it worked beautifully. It was a way for them to raise revenue by a significant percent, despite the fact that they're in a very competitive market with a lot of these branded products going off patent, and so on. For them to raise revenue by something over 10% with basically no cost associated with it whatsoever. And on a forward-looking basis, recognizing that they've created and they've recognized and locked in all of this future value that will continue to manifest over time. I just love that idea of, first of all, just a nice B2B example, but also that idea of taking CLV, and taking customer centricity, and using in a tactical way, in part of the organization that it wouldn't necessarily be thinking about all the time. It just shows that if you take some of these ideas, and instead of just trying to replicate some of the examples that we've covered, if you think really creatively about them. Where else can we do this? How else can we do this? And run those kinds of experiments, and start small, and build from there, and get buy in throughout the organization, amazing things can happen. I think Merial is a really good example in that regard.
###### 1.1.6.1.1.5. Customer Analytics Initiative
At the beginning of our time together, I mentioned that I'm the co-director at a research center, the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative. But I never really took the time to describe what it is that we do or how it fits in with my overall desire to get companies to understand and become more customer-centric. So let me tell you a little bit about both of those things. So what do we do? Well, actually, we're a matchmaker. We don't actually do the research. We'll find companies that are sitting on top of lots of interesting customer level data. So whether it's data about individual consumers buying things or whether it's physicians writing proscriptions or whether it's insurance brokers writing policies. We're very agnostic about what we mean by customer, and in all these cases the customers, whoever they may be, we have lots of data on what they're doing over time. And lots of desires to extract insights from that data to help the company become more customer-centric. So, here's the way it works. We'll sit down with a company and we'll talk about all the different data assets that they have and all the business problems that either arise from or motivate some of those data assets. Then we'll hold a webinar, and we'll basically announce those data assets. We don't give the data away, but we'll describe the data to academics all over the world. So all schools, all disciplines, all geographies, we basically say, hey researchers, here's this dataset, or this set of datasets. What would you do with it if you could get access to it? You tell us. What theories would you test? What models would you develop? What algorithms would you come up with? You tell us what's interesting, both from an academic and a commercial standpoint, write us a proposal. We'll get 40 or 50 proposals. We'll sort them into buckets based on what techniques people are proposing or what substantive questions they're attempting to answer. Then we can go to the company and say, hey, company, here's 40 great ideas. Some of them might be more interesting and relevant than others, and that's fine. You pick as many of them as you want. You pick, say, a dozen of them. We'll go back to those researchers, give them the data and say go to it. And at the end of the process a few months later, we'll have this private symposium where the company gets together with all of these academics to talk about the data and the insights and the commercial value. And it's really terrific, because all too often we'll have practitioners and academics kind of talking over each other's heads, thinking that the other one doesn't understand the problem. But if we have the company that gave us the data and all those academics that have been working on it, they're seeing eye-to-eye. We'll see just tremendous insights, and again, commercial value that can be tied to meaningful financial results arising from these projects. So part of it is that it's nice to see better research happen. It's nice to help companies raise their quantitative literacy. It's nice to have researchers work on more practical, relevant problems than the usual ivory tower stuff. And this whole mechanism is just a nice way to bring customer-centricity across. because while I'm talking to companies and talking about customer-centricity and everything that we've been covering here, sometimes it's hard for them to get going. Sometimes they need the data, they need the metrics, the COV, the customer retention. So maybe we can start on that side and we can have top academics all around the world show them how they can derive some of those analytics from their data, and it becomes much easier for them to start to do the strategic thing as well. So it's just a really nice triangulation between the kind of pure talk that we have about the customer-centricity and the research work that we do. And it all meets together, and it all makes the world a better place. At least when it comes to customer-centricity.

```
Category points of parity are must-haves.
Competitive points of parity are optional and not unique to a certain brand. 

``` ad-question
title: what is the difference between competitive point of parity and category point of parity ? 
- Category Point of Parity represents all the all the features your brand should posses in order to be considered. You can consider smartphones as an example - people assume that phones have cameras, even though that isn't the main feature of a phone. There is a high probability that people wouldn't consider a smartphone without a camera.
- Competitive Point of Parity represents how your brand is advantageous over other brands among the similarities. You could consider the same example as above - smartphones. Samsung has released a camera with 108MP, and now some of it's competitors would probably offer it with much higher MP.

#### 3.1.1.4. Packaging
- Can influence at the point of purchase
- Can have a continuing influence at the point of consumption
- Multiple onjectives
    - Identify
    - present information (descriptive and persuasive)
    - Protect and allow transportation
    - Store
    - Aid consumption

```ad-question
title: How to create impactful packaging?
- Understand that package aesthetics and function are both critical
    - The package has to grab consumers' attention in a sea of competing messages
    - It has to work well so that customers buy it
- Know your distribution channels
    - How do retailers view your package?
    - How are channels changing?

```

### 3.1.2. Persuasion

```ad-question
title: What is persuation
An active attempt to change belief and attitude
```

- Caveat: Difficult!
	- People expose themselves, pay attention to and interpret data consistent with what they already believe. And because they're not scientific about it, and evenly sampling and exposing themselves to all sorts of different things and paying attention to things that both support their prior belief and refute their prior belief, because they're very biased in the way they take in that stimuli, it's hard to persuade them to think differently.
```ad-question
title: What is the best way to persuade people?
- Elaboration likelyhood model
- [ ] books on persuation
```


```ad-question
title: What is the Elaboration likelyhood model?
According to the elaboration likelyhood model there are 2 routes to persuation:
[[#Systematic central]]
[[#superficial peripheral processing]]

[[Marketing in a Digital World#6.2.2.1 Elaboration likelihood model (ELM)]]

```



##### 3.1.2.1.1. Systematic (central)
- When motivation (involvement), opportunity and ability to process marketing messages are high
- Ficus mainly on "central clues" in the message

```ad-question
title:What does the central route say if people are motivated and highly involved, have the opportunity and the ability to process marketing messages?
That the way to persuade them is through central cues in messages
```

```ad-question
title:What does this mean?
In other words, cognitive cues, things that people have to think about. Try to make a strong argument. In order to make a strong argument, people have to be paying attention, they have to be motivated, and they have to have the ability to process this information.
```

```ad-question
title:What if people just aren't motivated to think that much; don't want to think that much or don't have the ability (they're too tired or whatever)?
In that case, central processing or central route to persuasion will not work.
```

```ad-question
title:What to do if people have low motivation?
Then you will have to use the [[#superficial peripheral processing|superficial way]] , which is to use these peripheral cues and so when when your opportunity, motivation and ability to elaborate, to cognitively process is low, then the way to persuade people is use, is through these peripheral cues
```


```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Exposure to marketing] --> B(Motivate to elaborate)
  B --> |high involvement| C(ability to elaborate)
  B --> |low involvement| D(Peripheral route)
  C -->|No| D(Peripheral route)
  C -->|High ability| E[Central route]
```




##### 3.1.2.1.2. superficial (peripheral) processing
- When motivation, opportunity, ability and elaboration likelihood are low
- Focus primaily on "peripheral clues" in messages
mental shortcuts

```ad-question
title: What are peripheral clues
- Classical conditioning
	- you persuade people just by putting things together all the time.
	- If things are always together; after a while you don't even think about it, and you just act
		- I'm having a Big Mac, let me have a Coke. That, that's a kind of notion of classical conditioning. It's not well thought out. It's just, I'm persuaded to have a Coke because I always have had one. 
- reciptocity
    - you owe me (desire to pay back)
- Consistency
    - we've always done it that way
- Social proof
    - everybody's doing it
- Liking
    - If you're like me you, then you like my ideas
- Authority
    - just because I say so
- Scarecity
    - Quick, before it is gone
- [ ] what other peripheral cues are there

```

##### 3.1.2.1.3. Celebrity endorcement


```ad-question
title:What makes a good celebrity endorser?
- Does the celebrity fit our audience 
- Does the celebrity fit our brand
- Does the celebrity's audience fit our audience
- What makes the celebrity attractive
- Practical considerations (cost,celebrity exposure, risk)
- social network
- Q-rating
```

```ad-question
title: How does influencer marketing work?
1. By "transfer of meaning" model
Celebrities are individuals charged with detailed and powerful meanings.
fMRI scans showed us very small brain activity when presented with images of celebrities "a viscreal reaction to celebrity"
	- different parts of the brain glow when find. Showing a celebrity versus when showing a normal person.
2. source credibility
	- Effectiveness depends on celebrity's expertness and trustworthiness.
1. source attractivenes
	- effectiveness depends on familiarity, likability and similarity.
		- fammiliarity - knowledge of the source through exposure
		-   likability - affection for the source as a result of the source's physical appearence and behaviour
		-   similarity - supposed resemblance between the source and receiver of the message
```

```ad-question
title: How marketers use influencers?
Advertisers choose Celebritiy that best represents the appropriate symbolic properties of the product.
```

```ad-question
title: How are celebrities used in advertisements?
- Explicit mode I endorse this product.
- Implicit note I use this product.
- imperative mode. you should use this poduct
- Co-presenter mode celebrity appears with the product.
```

### 3.1.3. Brand Messaging & Communication
```ad-question
title: What is perception?
- The process of developing an interpretation of a stimulus.
- Deciding what a stimulus means
```

```ad-question
title: Why is that important?
- What customers perceive is what affects their action and behaiviour
- What they perceive is not necessarily what is true, but it is true to them. It is what they believe
```

#### 3.1.3.1. Process of perception
Perception is constructive. Meaning people construct interpretations as a function of context.

```ad-question
title: What are the perceptions based on?
1. the actual stimulus or event: Exposure and attention (what is salient to them)
 - More often than not you purposefuly expose yourself to fammiliar things (confirmation bieas). And sometimes it is accidental exposure
2. Our prior expectation and what we know (perceptual interpretation)
```

```ad-question
title: What types of attention there are?
1. Voluntary
2. Non-voluntary
- [ ] define them
```

```ad-question
title: What is the perceptual process?
Sensory inputs --> Exposure --> attention --> interpretation 
```

### 3.1.4. Repositioning a brand
rebranding

```ad-warning
title: a brand has to be updated
-  the brand equity must be actively managed over time. 
    - If you wait until a brand is out-of-date, it's much harder then to re-position the brand. So ideally, the best way to keep a brand fresh is to constantly think about it. Might tweak it here and there. Think about it all the time so that it stays fresh. That would be the best way.
- Brand meanings must be reinforced
- sometimes they need to be adjusted just a little bit 
- new ways of identifying the equity should be identified
```
2:00
```ad-warning
title: Reasons for repositioning:
1. The identity/execution was poorly conceived
2. ...
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A(Myself) -->|+| B(bad habit)
    B -->|+| C(bad consequesnces)
    C -->|-| A
```

### 3.1.5. Experiential Branding
 > It is not enough to have a clear purpose (Brand Mantra). It must be used to align all of the experience that exist around the brand - **customer experience throughout each customer touchpoint**.


```ad-question
title: What is an experience             
- processes that occur as a result of encountering, undergoing or living through situations.
- triggered simulations to the senses, heart and mind
- you can sence and feel an experience, and then recall it from memory 
- They connect the company and the brand to the customer's lifestyle, and place individual customer actions and purchase occasions in a broader social context.

    - Just how intimate do we want to get?
    - How do we actually make more money on something that actually adds costs than some of these other strategies?
```

#### 3.2.1.1. The product-centric approach
```ad-tip
title: Product centric *business model*
It was the standart, but now there are many more business models than just:
-  performance superiority strategy
- operational excellence strategy
```

```ad-question
title: What is the overall objective for most commercial enterprises?

!!! ad-goal
    title: **Maximizing shareholder value** (the value of the whole cooperation)
    - maximizing the net present value of profits that the company is going to get

    title: The competitive advantage is **product expertise**
    collapse: close
```

```ad-question
title: where does growth come from with a performance superiority or eperational excellence?
1. Market development
2. Product development
    - ask the R&D department to create a new product\service
    - "You have a certain degree of expertise that has enabled you to bring us the current product. What more can you do to bring us either variance of that product, or entirely new ones that haven't existed before?"
    
!!! ad-question
    title: Are they simmilar?
    - Both of them share this basic idea: "We have a certain degree of product expertise. How can we extend it? How can we take that product expertise, and either extend it to new customers or extend it to new products? ""
    - So regardless of the specific way that you go after growth, *the main source of growth is extending our overall product or service delivery*.

```ad-list
title: Cracks in the Product-Centric Approach
!!! ad-success
    title: Technology-enabled product development --> commodization
    - back in the old days, it was so hard to come up with an idea and manufacture a new product, or deliver a service, that you would stay steps ahead of all of your competitors for a long period of time before they could come up with an equivalent idea.
    !!! ad-success
        title:  because of technology - today
        - Things *commoditize much more quickly*.
        - *Product life cycles are getting much, much shorter*.
        - Companies know that *as soon as they launch something new, they have to have the next new thing already in process*.
        !!! ad-question
            title: the power of natural monopoly fades
            - In the product-centric world, every company is counting on some kind of natural monopoly. We're doing something that's going to keep us ahead of all of our competitors for a long period of time. And that's what's going to let us focus on the dev, developing the best of delivering the most efficient. But as those life cycles shorten, as things commoditize, it takes away some of that natural monopoly power.
            
!!! ad-success
    title: Technology-enabled information flow --> Smart customers
    - Customers are so *much smarter, more informed* than ever before.
    - They're much **more informed**.
    - They're much **more demanding**.
    - They're **much savvier**.
    - Customers are so _much **more aware** of options that are available to them_, or options that might not yet be available to them, but they expect then to be soon (count thedays until the release)
    - smarter customers put much more demands on, on companies, and make it harder for them to extract as much value out of the products and services that they deliver.
    - Today's customers are much different from yesterday's customers. 
    !!! ad-question
        title: How it was back then?
        - It used to be that our customers were much more passive. They would take whatever products or services that we would give them, and they would say:"oh, that's great, terrific, thanks very much, I'll figure out how to use it". The customers were passive.
!!! ad-success
    title: Technology-enabled delivery --> retail saturation
    !!! ad-example
        title: Products are now available everywhere instantaneously
        - If you think about what FedEx, or DHL, or UPS, does they take away some of that natural monopoly power that a company had. In the old days, companies would rely on the fact that no one else had a product like them. But even if other companies did have a product like them, customers wouldn't be aware of it. And even if customers were aware of it, customers wouldn't have access to it.
    !!! ad-success
        title: But today, because *distribution technology* brings everything, everywhere overnight if you want it, it's much harder to protect yourself from other products and services that are available in other regions.
        collapse: close
!!! ad-success
    title:  Globalization
    People are thinking globally much more than ever before. So, customers are much more actively looking for products and services from other regions than they ever were before.
!!! ad-success
    title: Deregulation
    !!! ad-question
        title: What is regulation?
        Regulation was that gave companies monopoly power, as they were the only game in town and customers had no choice.
    But as one industry after another deregulates, companies need to be much more competitive. And it's much harder to stay a step ahead. And in some cases, it's not deregulation, but it's re-regulation. It's regulations that are making markets much more competitive.
    
!!! ad-success
    title: Customers want"end-to-end solutions", which may require products/services from bultiple vendors
    !!! ad-example
        title: IBM 
        Not only deliver them one product or service at a time, but bundled together products and services. Sometimes, including products and services that the company might not make any money on. It is now much more imperative than it ever was before for companies to **be seen as a trusted advisor**. To be **providing full fledged solutions** to the customer and not just piece meal products and services that the customer will figure out how to combine together. 
        - From the ultimate product developer --> a trusted advisor
!!! ad-success
    title: Information systments enable **customer-level tracking**
    Enabled us to collect and manage, and utilize data about customers, in a way that we just could have never imagined before. So if you think about old companies. 
    !!! ad-tip
        title: Now, it's much more important for companies to be *using the data* about their customers. 
        - To be understanding who's buying what?
            - For how long?
            - What other products that they're buying?
        So the information systems give us the possibility of developing business models that were unimaginable before, but *could actually be more successful* than the product-centric approach.

creative aspects of communication
- message design
media planning and budgeting
- reach and frequency
- budgeting
measuring the effects of the comunication campaign


#### 3.3.1.1. Designing a Communications Campaign
- communications strategy
    - mass and targeted media (Tv,digital, print, outdoor)
        - Aadvertising : outbound (TV and radia) or inbound (digital, search)
        - Product placement
        - Public Relations
    - Personal and interpersonal means
        - sales force
        - Word of Mouth (off-line, on-line)
    - Point of purchase/in-store
- non-comunications
    - price discounts
    - coupons
```ad-warning
title: Anything that looks like an adverisement is less effective, thansomething that is somewhat indirect. 
- branded content (LEGO, Red Bull)
```

```ad-question
title: Is PR free?
Public relations is not really free. What is really free in the public relations part is that you don't pay for the media, which means you don't pay for time and space. But creating an activity that deserves public relations and media mentions is reasonably expensive.
```
Key trends
- media chice is determined by campaign design
    - first we are to design the campaign properly then select the media rather than the other way round.
-  Overall spend in terms of time people spend on various media that is changing. Television is going down, some of the digital media is increasing. I think that's very consistent with our intuition

```ad-warning
title: 1% increase in Price leads to 11,1 increase in operating profits
Even though people realize how important pricing is, they still don't know how to use it properly.

```

```ad-question
title: How to do it right?
Good pricing is a balancing act!
```
It requires good understanding of:
- economics
- psychology 
    - consumer psychology 
    - psychology of people who made pricing decisions
- statistics
- operations research
- computer science
- courace
- common sence

#### 3.4.1.1. Drivers of price sensitivity 
(under what conditions are consumers more or less price sensitive)
1. Availability and awareness of substitudes
    - substitutes that exist, greater will be the price sensitivity
2. Ease of direct comparison
    - private labels vs national brands
3. Total expenditure and fraction of your total costs (relative value in bundle)
    -  If you spend more on a product or a service you're going to be more price sensitive.
    -  Bigger families are more sensitive to the price of groceries
    -  If it's a bigger part of your cost structure, you'll be more price sensitive. But if it's a very small part of your cost structure, you'll be less price sensitive. 
4. shared cost (employer pays part)
5. switching cost
6. price/quality inferences
7. ability of customers to carry inventory

#### 3.4.1.3. Psychological Aspects of Pricing

effect of 9 and 5 price ending
Weber Fechner law
    - customers react to prices in percentage terms as opposed to absolutes
endowment effects
- endowment effects don't rely on actual ownership, just perception of ownership
- implications: make customers feel they own it, before they buy  
reference price effects
context effects: leading to the choice of the intermediate option
- buyers compare the current price with a reference price
- reference price is often determined by past prices paid
- influencing reference price:
    - list price
    - starting price: as in infomercial
```ad-list
title: Takeaway
- effective pricing captures value andleaves as little as possible on the table
- customer price sensitivity is a mojor imput into pricing decisions
- considering the psychological effects of pricing can improve profitability

[[Marketing in a Digital World#16.4.1 pricing strategy]]

##### 3.4.1.4.1. Margin/contribution 
```ad-question
title: What is margin analysis?
A table of costs and prices for every member of the value chain (Manufacturer, channel member, end-user) for every relevent product (whitin the product like and across competitors)
```
```ad-question
title: What it does?
- Reveals everyone's incentives in a purchasse transaction
- careful examination allows the discovery of potential problems
    - cannibalization
    - channel conflict
- provides input for subsequent analysis
```

```ad-question
title: possible issues
```
- Will the new product cannibalize existing products and lower our profits?
- Will customers want it?
- Will our channel partners support it?
- Can we produce so many more units?
- Do we have the supportchain and the distribution network to support it?

```ad-summary
title: Conclusion and lessons
It's is important to choose the righ denominator
```
- While precision in the numerator is important, what is strategically critical is the choice of the determination
- Should it be per customer or per lens?
    - It depends on waht is your binding constant or a key resource
- A traditional retailer computes margin per square foot of shelf space when deciding which products to support because shelf space is their critical resource
- A law firm or a consulting firm does not compute revenue per square foot, they compute revenue per consultant hour in deciding which opportunities are more attractive


##### 3.4.1.4.2. Break-even analysis

- Many times a customer's decision on what product to buy is also based on their experience in the store at the point of purchase, whether it's a bricks-and-mortar store or an online store.
-  It's also important to recognize that most businesses often spend significantly more money on creating appropriate customer access for their product or service, than they spend on advertising or promotions.
-  What's interesting is that most companies don't even know the cost of it because it does not show up on your income statement. What you recognize is the price at which you sell to your channel partner or your distributor. The difference is what they charge the end-user. t is not even showing up on your income statement because it's really you not recognizing that channel margin because that's from the income statement of the channel partner.
-  How we create customer access or what we call traditionally creating a distribution channel can also be a great source of competitive advantage, and a disruptor in the marketplace.

>some of those being disrupted were one disrupters too.

### 3.5.1. Creating Customer Access

In order for any of us to buy a product or a service, (1) we need to have access to relevant information (needed to make the purchase), and (2)we should be able to execute our purchase through the right logistics.
> the scale of the provider and the importance to the buyer of information logistics drives optimal channels structure.

#### 3.5.1.1. Basic Information needs

##### 3.5.1.1.1. Primary information
Why should I pay so much for a new idea? How will it work? How will I use it?

##### 3.5.1.1.2. comparative information

Why should I buy from you and not someone else? 

#### 3.5.1.2. Logistics
```ad-question
title: What are the components of logistics?
- Convenience and accessibility + quantity
- time between order and receipt of goods
- brocken or missing parts
- problems with assembly
