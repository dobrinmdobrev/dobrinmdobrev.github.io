- Tiffany White
    - Well, marketing to me is all the things that firms do to try to create value for consumers in the marketplace and an increasingly crowded marketplace. So that it has to do with all the points of contact that a consumer might have with a firm, for example, in the marketplace, what kinds of products they see, how those things are packaged, how they are present. So yeah, it's got to do with the physical component, but it also has to do with the essence of the brands that consumers see in the marketplace and all the work that goes into telling a story about what this brand is and why this brand is different from other brands in a way that's meaningful and value and distinct and makes you want to choose not just any product, but that specific product. 
- Hayden Noel
    - Marketing is about developing customer relationships, developing long-term relationships with consumers through providing them with goods or services that are tailored to their needs.

What the seller offer is often a product, but a product can be a phisical, product, a service, an idea or an experience. We tend to think that the buyer is providing money to acuire these offerings, but they can also provide their attention,  time, energy.

# 1. How Digital Tools are Changing Product

##### 1.1.1.1.1. Overview

How has the digital revolution altered the way that products are marketed? In this module, you will learn how new digital tools are enabling customers to take a more active role in developing and sharing **products**. After introducing the notion of what a product is and how products are changing, we will explore how University of Illinois students, members of the Internet Generation, use digital tools to offer product ideas to companies. This module will then explore two important digital concepts: **Customer Co-creation** and **Sharing Economy**.

In addition to learning about these concepts, you will also have the opportunity to apply them by participating in a hands-on exercise peer review (**Ideas.Lego.com**) \[Honors Assignment\] and through a real-world case study peer review (**Threadless**). As a result of these various learning activities, you will develop a deep understanding about how digital tools are transforming the product landscape.

###### 1.2.3.1.1.2. How do you develop new products?
Through line extending strategies <!-- such as launching new products - introdusing new extentions of the product --> the firm could target [[#^e0f0df|different offerings to different segments]]

```ad-question
title: What do you meen by "different offerings to different segments"?
Well, each segment has specific needs and wants, therefore it deserves a specific to their needs and wants offering. By extending the product line, to accomudate their distinct needs, with a variation of our best-selling product, we give them a way of entering our customer base (company's family). What is more, this new product is not supposed to canibalize our other products, if our current customers are satisfied with our current offering for them. They should be so distinct that they do not compete and therefore, there is no cannibalization.

## 1.3. Digital Concept 1: Customer Co-Creation
##### 1.3.1.1.1. What is the core idea behind customer co-creation
The realization that customers can help companies improve their new product development activities 
by both contributing ideas as well as selecting ideas for possible new offerings.

```ad-warning
title: customers are not only buying products, they may also help design and develop them.
collapse: close
```

Co-creation is defined as contributions made by customers(and non-customers) that assist a firm in the design and development of a new product offering. 
```ad-question
title: How are contributions made?
Contributions are usually made through a web-based platform and often come in digital form.
```

#### 1.3.1.2. Steps involved in co-creation
 customer co-creation as a process of both (1) contribution and (2)selection.
 - a firm must get its customers to submit contributions. 
 - it must select a few valuable contributions from much a larger set of ideas

```ad-question
title: Are there challenges?
```




##### 1.3.1.2.1. Challenges
 Contributions are challenging because customers are busy. They typically care very little about your products and don't have much time or incentive to spend on giving you their ideas. As a result, many co-creation efforts fail because **the submissions are simply too low**.
 
 selection is challenging because most of the submissions are not very useful. They may be too idiosyncratic, too expensive, or have already been tried and don't work. As a result, firms face the difficult task of having to reject customer submissions and risk creating a bad will with some of the most highly engaged customers.

##### 1.3.1.2.2. How to be successful in customer co-creation?
```ad-question
title: How to motivate customers to engage in customer co-creation
collapse: close
```

1. The firms (1) convince their customers to submit ideas and (2) then reject those ideas without alienating them. 
2. Motivate customers to engage in this activity
	- social recognition
	- financial reward
```ad-question
title: What about social recognition and second, financial reward? 
Most firms that are successful in this process typically employ both of these types of rewards.
```
```ad-question
title: So everbody wins, righ?
Well.. not exactly. Ssually, these rewards go to customers whose contributions have been selected. And those how are not selected are satisfied with the experence.
!!! ad-qusetion
	title: When are they not satisfied?
```


#### 1.3.1.3. Types of co-creation

collaborating, co-designing, tinkering, and submitting
Collaborating is a form in which firms have the least amount of control, while submission is the form that provides firms with the greatest amount of control. 
![[Types of Co-Creation.png]]

5# type of co-creation"design crowdsoucing" Allen the impact of design crowdsourcing upon product performance.
s the practice of soliciting functional design solutions from the crowd
- design crowdsourcing has a positive impact on the sales of new products that are low in customer appeal, but have no effect on the sales of products that are high in customer appeal.
- firms are more likely to engage in design crowdsourcing for products that are more technologically complex.


Micael Dahlen. It was published in 2018 in the Journal of Marketing Communications - how customer development in the development and selection of ideas for new products is viewed by other customers.

- more favorable impression of both the product and the restaurant when customers *contribute* ideas for an 
incongruent product
- they found the opposite when customers *selected* ideas. They had a more favorable impression for both the product and the restaurant when the product was congruent

> Firms should use customers to contribute ideas for products that are different than ones they currently offer, but to use customers to select ideas for products that are similar to the ones they currently offer.



#### 1.3.1.4. Practical Recommendations
##### 1.3.1.4.1. The rule of 1
When firms engage in new product development, they carefully test their ideas and concepts to ensure that 
they appeal to their broader set of target customers. In contrast, when customers contribute  their new product ideas, they don't engage in this type of process. As a result, many of these customer ideas are rather idiosyncratic in nature, and may not appeal to other customers.
```ad-example
title: As a result of these types of personal idiosyncrasies:
I prefer tea over coffee, I'm not a coffee drinker. Thus if Starbucks asked me for my ideas, I would suggest they offer more tea and less coffee. Now this would probably be a bad idea since most Starbucks' customers seem to prefer coffee rather than tea.
```
```ad-warning
title: Companies need to get lots of ideas, provide incentives for customers to contribute.
As only about 1% are good enough to implement
```

##### 1.3.1.4.2. Authenticity
What facilitate customer co-creation
authenticity is becoming increasingly important, and customers are becoming increasingly skeptical and critical of companies. As a result, customers are much more likely to contribute their ideas, time, and energy to companies that have an authentic need for their help, and not just trying to exploit their efforts for commercial gain. 
	- For example, customers seem quite willing to contribute t-shirt designs to Threadless because its co-creation activity is viewed as highly authentic. Threadless began as a co-creation company, that's what they do. In contrast, customers would probably be less likely to give ideas for t-shirts to a traditional manufacturer that employs a large number of in-house designers.
##### 1.3.1.4.3. Patches and badges
We all like to be rewarded for our efforts. 
Customers who engage in co-creation are no exception. Thus, most successful co-creation initiatives award successful cocreators, not just financially, but also through some visible symbol of recognition.
	For example,the US Space Agency, NASA, rewards co-creators by giving them a special patch they can proudly display. In fact, NASA found that this ==patch was a stronger motivator than a financial reward==.
##### 1.3.1.4.4. Share the guilt of selection with the comunity
Do not be the vilain in the story,engage your broader customer community to evaluate, vote on, and select these contributions.
	Thus, fellow customers felt that the rejected ideas came from the community rather than from Dell itself. This help reduce the sting of rejection and help to avoid making Dell look like the bad guy

## 1.5. Digital Concept 2: Sharing Economy
In essence, the sharing economy connects individuals who have things they want to share with others who need 
these things. ^5j940h
```ad-warning
title: Technology-enabled platforms that provide users with temporary access to resources that may be crowdsourced.
this definition has three key components
	- Inherintly *digital* in nature & run on technology platforms
	- Grant *temporary access* rather than permanent ownership <!-- profesor raggu and the mug experiment -->
	- Resources are often owned by *external iduviduals*
```


#### 1.5.1.1. Two-sided platform
In essence, this is a business model that requires firms to recruit not only customers but also providers. In contrast, a traditional firm usually only has to attract customers because they create their own supply of products or services. The sharing economy firms have to themselves not only to create demand but also to create supply. This is not an easy task. Due to this challenge, some sharing platforms have decided to own their own 
supply.

#### 1.5.1.2. Access not ownership
 providing customers with temporary access rather than permanent ownership
 
 ```ad-question
 title: What implecations does it have?
 1. by providing temporary access customers have the opportunity to try products and services that would not be able to/want to own
 2. brands that are accessed rather than owned are less central to our self-identity and create lower levels of brand attachment.
	- Thus **brands maybe less important in the sharing economy** than in the traditional economy.
		- For example, Uber riders have no control over the brand of vehicle that picks them up and usually seem to care more about the driver than they care about the car they are driving.



```

Although some sharing platforms like RTR own their own supply, most crowdsource are supply of housing, transportation, or money from a large group of outside individuals who are not employees. Now because they're not employees sharing platforms have limited control over these individuals. As a result, the quality of a sharing economy offering is usually less consistent and harder to 
control compared to a traditional firm. 
#### 1.5.1.3. Crowdsource supply
- Suppliers are not employees and platforms havelimited control over them
- Quality of offering is less consistent
	- carefull selection
		- by conducting extensive background checks.
	- training
		- giving providers a set of rules and procedures to follow
	- rating system that encourages customers to provide ratings of their providers and then eliminating providers that obtain lower ratings


#### 1.5.1.4. types of sharing economy platforms
![[Pasted image 20210523204811.png]]
enablers, 
forums,
matchmakers,
hubs.
> sharing economy firms are an important competitor to existing business models, especially at lower price points


#### 1.5.1.5. No answers yer
```ad-question
title:  
how profitable this new business model will be?
how this new economy will impact traditional businesses or how these traditional firms should respond to this potential threat?
What is the social impact of the sharing economy?
```
the sharing economy has been viewed as having a positive effect on the environment by making greater use of existing resources.

### 1.5.2. Practical recommendations
#### 1.5.2.1. Leverage your prosumers
most sharing platforms rely upon crowdsourced resources - prosumers. They also provide sharing platforms with a variety of other benefits. Thus sharing economy firms should carefully think about how they can fully leverage their prosumers. 

#### 1.5.2.2. Employ reverse ratings
Reverse ratings - customers rate providers & providers also rate customers. have to consider their ability to not only acquire and retain customers, but also providers. Employing a reverse rating system helps accomplish this goal by giving providers more information about their potential customers, which they can use to help determine if they want to even serve them.

#### 1.5.2.3. Ride the surge - match supply and demand
- Surge pricing increases the price of a shared service in a particular area when deman is high
- Balancing supply & deman by reducing customers willing to pay for service and increasing providers willing to serve
		During busy times, the supplier providers may be smaller than the demand for their services. Now a traditional firm can easily solve this problem by hiring or firing workers as needed. However, since sharing platforms really don't have employees this traditional approach is really not possible. Some sharing platforms such as Uber tackle this problem by engaging in surge pricing. In essence, this technique employs a calculation through an algorithm that increases the price of a shared service in a particular area when the demand becomes high. Surge prices are usually somewhere between two to three times higher than normal prices

#### 1.5.2.4. Position on price
the sharing economy is often viewed as a more sustainable form of consumption.
viewed as a way to build a stronger sense of community
```ad-warning
title: The sharing economy platforms should market their offerings, as a way to save money rather than save the world.
research suggests that these higher-order values are typically not the main reasons why customers engage with sharing platforms. Instead, the key advantage of these platforms appears to be their lower price and greater value.

# 2. How Digital Tools are Changing Promotion
##### 2.1.1.1.1. Overview 
How has the digital revolution altered the way that products are promoted in our digital world? In this module, you learn how new digital tools are enabling customers to take a more active role in promotion activities. After introducing the notion of promotion and how promotion is changing, we will explore how University of Illinois students, members of the Internet Generation, use digital tools to offer product reviews.

## 2.2. Basic Concept: Promotion
Promotions covers the methods of communication that a marketer uses to provide information about his products. 
we think of this information as being persuasive in nature, with the goal of getting customers to buy your product instead of its competitors.
This information can be both *verbal and visual*, and thus informational strategy can influence consumers by appealing to either their intellect or their emotions.
- Emotional appeal
- Intelectual appeal
### 2.2.1. Key concepts include
#### 2.2.1.1. personal selling
#### 2.2.1.2. sales promotion
#### 2.2.1.3. word of mouth

### 2.2.2. Fundamental concepts
#### 2.2.2.1. Advertising 
```ad-question
title: Who are ads targeted at?
Most advertising is targeted towards existing and potential customers.
```
However, advertising can also be directed to distribution channel partners, so does retailers, and also to build morale among its employees.
```ad-question
title: what is the goal of advertising?
The goal of advertising is to elicit some type of response. 
!!! ad-question
	title: How many types of responce a firm may seek?
	- a new brand may focus on developing awareness
	- an established brand may focus on changing perceptions. 
```
```ad-success
title: Most ads are
- carefully planned and developed.
- an advertising campaign creation
- pretest these ads before they're launched
- launch 
- track ad effectiveness 
- decide when it needs to develop a new campaign. 
``` 

#### 2.2.2.2. Persuasion
```ad-question
title: What is the main goal of most promotional campaigns?
To persuade customers to buy a firm's products instead of its competitors.
```
Thus, marketers often think of promotion as a form of persuasion. 
```ad-list
title: persuasion tactics: 
- celebrity endorsements
- humor
- scientific claims. 
```

##### 2.2.2.2.1. Elaboration likelihood model (ELM)
1. Rotes to persuasion
	1. central rount (cognitive)
		-  effective when:
			-   customers have the ability and motivation to process a persuasion message. 
			- Customers find the provided information to be newsworthy and believable. 
	2. Peripherral route (emotional)
		- Effective when:
			- Customers lack the ability and motivation to process the message.
			- Customer perceives the provider ofthe message to be credible or attractive.

persuasion tactics focus strongly on trying to convince customers that a product is appealing and is based on the premise that a firm needs to find the right message or message provider.
#### 2.2.2.3. What is changing?
##### 2.2.2.3.1. Promotion
![[Pasted image 20210523220505.png]]
Historically, most large firms have devoted most of the promotion budget to advertising. For the bulk of this expenditure, focus on television ads developed by professional advertising agency. Although a small number of customers are typically asked to provide their opinion about these ads through techniques such as copy testing, or concept testing. This process is largely top-down and focus, and most ads are designed to persuade customers to buy a firm's products, by first getting attention for its brand, and then persuading them to make a purchase.
	- copy testing, or concept testing
```ad-example
title: democratization of digital tools.
by leveraging the power of the digital and not engaging in traditional advertising, Tesla is able to effectively tell potential customers that story without appearing like its trying to sell them something.

## 2.3. Digital Concept 1: User General Content
Firms are very careful how they manage their promotions as they are quite expensive. Low-cost digital video cameras, free digital editing software, and online broadcasting platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, have made the creation and dissemination of promotional messages much cheaper and easier than ever before. As a result, a growing number of firms are taking advantage of these developments to reduce their promotional cost. 

> User generated content occurs when a product's customers create and disseminate online ideas about a product or the firm that markets the product.

### 2.3.1. Key characteristics
1. contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm that sells the product
2. creative in nature and the user adds something new
3. posted online and generally accessible to others

### 2.3.2. Types of User General Content
typically, you just see is non-commercial nature and doesn't make any types of direct promotional appeals. Thus, it is very indirect, subtle, and also an authentic form of product promotion.


blog postings
- product reviews
	-  the most common and also has the strongest impact on customer purchasing decisions various submissions

### 2.3.3. What motivate user to contribute?
-  The biggest motive appears to be social recognition. 
	-  Being an active contributor on a social media platform such as Facebook or Twitter, and they will provide a certain amount of fame and prestige, at least for some people.
	-  when a firm profiles their contributions on his web-page or in his advertisements.
		-   the yogurt company, Chobani, has placed its customer tweets on billboard signs throughout the US.
-  financial incentives
	-  some firms try to encourage UGC by holding contests that provide winners with cash, gift cards, or some other type of tangible reward.

### 2.3.4. What are the benefits of User General Content
1. lower cost for promotion
	-  this type of promotion is typically low cost since the content is provided by a firm's customers for free
2. Positively related to product sales
3. Customers thrust User General Content more than traditional promotions
4. Keeps content fresh
	- UGC also helps make a firms need to keep it's content fresh and makes their websites much more interesting
	- websites that feature UGC benefit both from higher traffic as well as longer page views

### 2.3.5. Motivating user generated content with performance feedback
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OOhKYe0r89Z3qbMRv48sKfrf7Rewmq-z/view?usp=sharing

- Cooperation feedback
	- impact of UGC on others. 
- individualistic feedback 
	- the quality of your ideas. 
- competition feedback
	- how much better your UGC was than that rovided by others
	
> the impact of these three different types of feedback depends upon an individual's gender. Among women, cooperation was the strongest motivator, while among men, competition was the strongest motivator for providing UGC.

```ad-warning
title: Firms can motivate individuals to generate UGC by giving them feedback about their contributions, and that the type of feedback should be different among men versus women.
collapse: close
```


### 2.3.6. How User General Content differs when it's created on a smartphone versus a personal computer
```ad-warning
title: the content of UGC is affected by the type of digital tool that's used to create it.
- UGC created on a smartphone is shorter and less detailed than user-generated content created on a personal computer.
- UGC created on a smartphone is more likely to be emotional and positive in nature.
-  firms should try to encourage their customers to generate UGC on their smartphones rather than on their computers
```
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022243718815429
### 2.3.7. Practical reccomendations
#### 2.3.7.1. Ask to share their comments
- direct their efforts towards your brand rather than your competitors.
	- that customers are more likely to provide favorable contributions if the firms are active in social media and that encourage their participation
	-  Ideally, promotional activities should encourage these conversations between both firms and customers.
		-  A good way to get this conversation started is to simply ask customers to share their ideas
#### 2.3.7.2. Be responsive
if you're lucky enough to receive some, you need to close the loop by being responsive
	- feedback
	- reward
 By being responsive to user contributions, firms are more likely to obtain higher levels of UGC in the future.

#### 2.3.7.3. the Pareto principle

This principle is also seen in UGC, where about 90 percent of the content is created by only 10 percent of its contributors. So not all contributors are equal, some are more influential than others. So identify these influential contributors and reward them for their efforts.

#### 2.3.7.4. integrate UGC with traditional promotion
UGC and advertising are quite different and often conducted as separate activities sometimes by separate individuals. Firm should consider trying to link these two forms of promotion together.

### 2.3.8. Go pro study

## 2.4. Digital Concept 2: Doppelganger Brands

a doppelganger brand image is an alter-ego of a brand that is negative in nature.
a doppelganger brand image is a collection of disparaging images and stories about a brand that are being circulated in popular culture by a loosely organized network of anti-brand activists, bloggers and opinion leaders. 
 usually focused on well-known brands that are viewed as lacking in authenticity and trying to create a false or misleading emotional appeal through their promotional activities
### 2.4.1. What motivates a Doppelganger Brand image
 the perception that a brand is being inauthentic by claiming to be something that it's not or disguising its true nature or effect.
 
### 2.4.2. What types of brands are most susceptable to a Doppelganger brand image
 Large well-known brands
 These brands have a high degree of awareness and familiarity, which means that their business practices are more likely to come to the attention of anti-brand activists. In addition, doppelganger campaigns targeted against these bigger brands are likely to get more attention for their creators, compared to those focused against small brands.
### 2.4.3. Where are Doppelganger Brand image found?
 often located on a individual's blog, Twitter account, or Facebook page. Now, sometimes these individual accounts are picked up by a larger digital media outlet, such as Reddit, Digg, BuzzFeed, or even more traditional news channels. DBIs can also be found on websites such as adbusters that are dedicated towards creating DBI for a wider variety of brands.
 
### 2.4.4. Practical reccomendations
 
 DBIs may have a negative impact on a consumer's willingness to buy a brand, and as a result, go to alternative competitors. 
 
 these doppelganger images actually shift over time in response to changing marketing claims, and also shows that managers can use a variety of tactics to combat these negative images, such as fostering brand communities and using customers to help market their brands. Now, here are four practical recommendations, for how firms and managers can combat and actually leverage a doppelganger brand image.
 
#### 2.4.4.1. monitor digital cues
  Firms should view DBIs not only as a threat, but also an opportunity to ensure that their brands stay relevant. Firms can take advantage of this opportunity by carefully monitoring digital cues for the potential signs of the emerging DBI.
  
  Brand managers should carefully and regularly monitor industry and brand related websites, social media channels, and review sites to keep an eye on any potential brand backlash.
  
  Tools for tracking brand related conversations such as Google Alerts, Topsy and Brandwatch
#### 2.4.4.2. identify and track brand avoiders
  Firms should also identify and track consumers who are avoiding their brand due to the presence of a DBI. Blogs and anti brand websites are good starting points for locating these individuals. 
  Now, once these avoiders are identified, a firm can and should conduct research to determine which specific doppelganger meanings are resonating most strongly with them.
  
#### 2.4.4.3. Develop & test a new story
  Firms need to be proactive, especially in a digital age.
  brand managers should seek to craft a new story that either addresses the DBI or bypasses it entirely.
  remain true to the brand, because an inauthentic story will quickly be detected, exploited by anti-brand activist.
  
#### 2.4.4.4. Vaccinate your brand from the threat of DBI
  doppelganger images are really viral marketing campaigns that offer a social critique about brand inauthenticity. Thus, firms may be able to vaccinate their brands from this critique by crafting their own viral marketing campaigns that display their brands in an authentic manner.
  
# 3. How Digital Tools are Changing Placement

## 3.1. Overview

How has the digital revolution altered the placement and distribution of products? In this module, you learn how new digital tools are altering the distribution of products and revolutionizing the retail landscape. After introducing the notion of placement and how it is changing, we will explore how University of Illinois students use digital tools in obtaining products. This module will then examine two important digital concepts: **New Retail** and **Desktop Manufacturing**.

In addition to learning about these concepts, you will also have the opportunity to apply them by participating in a hands-on exercise (**Thingiverse.com**) \[Honors Assignment\] and through a real-world case study (**Tesla**). As a result of these various learning activities, you will develop a deep understanding about how digital tools are transforming the placement landscape.


### 3.1.1. Goals and Objectives

-   Understand what placement is and how it fits into the marketing mix.
-   Appreciate how digital tools are changing how products are placed and distributed.
-   Differentiate old retail vs. new retail.
-   Learn what desktop manufacturing (3D printing) is and how it will revolutionize how products are distributed.
-   Analyze a real-world case that involves a new retailing company.
-   Engage in an exercise in which you gain hands-on knowledge of 3D printing \[Honors Assignment\].

### 3.1.2. Guiding Questions

## 3.2. Basic Concept: Placement
```ad-question
title: What is the focus of Placement
Making a product conveniently accessible to potential customers.
```

placement involves the physical movement of a product from manufacturer through a series of marketing channel intermediaries ending with the independent retailer. (add diagram). retailer then provides a number of important functions (like displaying the product upon it shelves and educating its staff about it's features so they can help sell it to potential customers).

```ad-example
title: It is nearly impossible to walk into a store in most parts of the world and not to be able to buy a bottle or a can of Coke. That's good placement.
collapse: close
- Coke is a great example of a firm that has effectively employed this aspect of the marketing mix. 
Coke distributes is product, really it's formula, to a network of over 250 bottling partners around 
the world. These distributors mix the coke formula with water, bottle it, and ship these bottles or 
cans to a network of warehouses, which in turn distribute this product to over 16 million retailers 
in more than 180 countries around the world. These retailers include not only grocery stores, but 
also convenience stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and vending machines
```

### 3.2.1. key concepts 
#### 3.2.1.1. inventory management
#### 3.2.1.2. logistics, 
#### 3.2.1.3. sales force management.




### 3.2.2. fundamental concepts
#### 3.2.2.1. distribution 
- The distribution channel is typically outsourced to a series of independent firms
	- an importer
	- a wholesaler
	- a retailer
- The distribution process is often lengthy and requires substantial resources in terms of both time and money. Each member of this channel is typically independent from the other members, so **each participant is trying to maximize their revenues while minimizing their cost**.
- a manufacturer needs to carefully select and closely monitor each of his channel partners. 
	- This is a very difficult and costly endeavor that typically drives up the price of this products.
#### 3.2.2.2. retailing
The retailer is typically the final step in the distribution chain.
Selecting the type and number of retailers affects the type and number of customers that can acquire a product.
```ad-example
title: Luxury vs lower-riced goods:
For example, firms that produce luxury goods like Louis Vuitton employ an intensive placement strategy by making their products available at only a few exclusive retailers. In contrast, lower priced consumer goods like toothpaste and shampoo, typically employ an extensive placement strategy by making their products available to as many different retailers as possible.
```
retailers provide different degree of customer service
	- self-service
		Some 
retailers, like convenience stores, are largely self-service operations where customers locate 
and stark products with almost no assistance from the retailer.
	- full-service
		 In contrast, full-service retailers, like high-end department stores, take a much more active role in assessing a customer's needs and locating the right product for them.

### 3.2.3. What is changing
#### 3.2.3.1. Traditional approach
most products are sold through an extensive network of distributors and retailers. These firms play important functions by **helping get this product into the hands of customers**. Now, these functions are not free. Typically, a manufacturer receives about 60-70 percent the products retail price. Thus, traditional product placement is a very expensive proposition for both firms as well as customers. 

#### 3.2.3.2. New apprach
This traditional approach is beginning to break down due to the rise of digital tools.
Today, many firms are supplementing or even bypassing physical retailers by making their products directly available at either an online retailer like Amazon.com or on their own website.

Surprising is the fact that digital tools are now capable of not only replacing the retailer, but the entire distribution channel. 
Today, even large online retailers (like Amazon.com) have to physically ship products from the manufacturer to the customer. However, newly emerging tools (such as 3D printers) are now making it possible to eliminate the distributor, by allowing a firm to ship a digital design rather than a physical product.
> in this new digital marketing environment, we are moving from long channels for physical goods to short channels for digital goods.



## 3.3. Digital Concept 1: New Retail
- websites 
	- allow customers to both obtain information about their products and also buy them online.
	
A growing number of retailers (such as Walmart) have made it easy for customers to *order online and then pick up their products at the store*.
Some retailers have even decided, if you can't beat them, join them, they're now selling their merchandise through popular online shopping websites (like Amazon or Alibaba).
Also, several physical stores are starting to use digital tools to enhance the shopping experience.

> new retail is a collection of strategies: some physical, some digital, that physical retailers are using to react to the changes of operating in a digital world


### 3.3.1. how physical retailers are adapting in response to this new digital world, to form a new retail landscape?
#### 3.3.1.1. Issues surrounding retailing in a digital world
- location
	- location is the single most important factor when it comes to selling a home. Thus, it is better to have a bad house in a good neighborhood, than a good house in a bad neighborhood. The importance of location also extends to retailing. 
	- people who have access to well-priced physical stores are less likely to shop online
		- online shopping is more likely to occur among consumers living in small towns (like Champaign), and those living in big cities (like Chicago). Thus, the appeal of the digital is strongly influenced by one's physical environment 
- purchase versus information
	- Customers visit digital retailers for a purchase and for information
		- Amazon.com provides a product description, extensive technical information, and also user reviews for most of the products that it sells.
	-  consumers that visit digital retailers can not only purchase products, but also obtain information about them.
	-  showrooming
		-  Customers first visit a physical store and then order online
	-  webrooming
		-  first obtain information about a product online, and then buy it in a physical store
- digital and physical
	- > We tend to think of digital and physical as two entirely separate things. Indeed, these two forms of retail are quite different in many ways. retailers are seeking ways to blend the two together
	- Omnichannel Marketing
		- > the idea that retailers need to take advantage of the strengths of each of these two shopping channels
		- benefit of physical retail
			- returning products

- "smark phones, bad calls?" by Scianda, Inman
	- 15% of shoppers used their phones while shopping
	- Majority used phone to talk/text rather than for shopping-related tasks
	- Shoppers who talked/texted forgot to purchase nearly 1/3 of their planed items
	- Shoppers engaged in higher levels of impulse buying
		- can it be because they seak dopamine hits from the shopping experience while not looking at their phones?
	- Smartphones often distract shoppers by taking their focus away from the shopping task, and that this distraction reduces the purchase of items they planned to buy while increasing the purchase of things they didn't plan to buy.

- "How 3D virtual reality stores can shape consumer purchase decisions" by Kang, Shin & Ponto
	- Virtual reality benefits
		- visual-special clues
			- visualize a product in 3 dimensional space
		- Interactivity
			- rotate and examine a product in virtual space
		- These two benefits allow shoppers to gain more information about a product and also be more playful with it.
		- Increased sense of playfulness 
		- increased customer purchase intentions.

### 3.3.2. Practical reccomendations
#### 3.3.2.1. Market to shoppers
- shopper marketing
	- > understanding and influencing the behavior of shoppers once they enter a physical store.
	- smart shopping carts
	-  make customer shopping experience more enjoyable
		-  shopping malls are now turning into entertainment centers, complete with amusement rides, water-slides, and even ski slopes.




#### 3.3.2.2. Enhancing the phsycial by adding the digital
Digitalize the in-store experience
In addition to allowing customers to purchase online, some forward-looking retailers are starting to digitize the in-store experience. 
Sephora, a French beauty retailer, has installed something called magic mirrors in its stores. These are augmented reality devices, that allow customers to digitally see how different types of makeup would look on their face without actually having to touch a physical product.

#### 3.3.2.3. Use the power of touch
Many customers have a strong desire to touch products before buying them
More likely to buy product that they are able to touch

The ability to touch a product before buying it is an inherent advantage for physical retailers. Thus, they should leverage this advantage as fully as possible. 
```ad-example
title: Coco-mat lets tired shoppers take a nap on its mattresses. 
In addition to taking advantage of customers need for touch, this is also a great way to *keep customers in their store for a longer period of time.*
```

#### 3.3.2.4. Tiny and temporary
big-box store are simply too big and their costs are too high. It also cost a lot to shut them down. Retailers can:
Reduce risk & save money by setting up a pop-up store

Small stores that exist for a period of time
Relativelt low fixed costs and generate substantial attention and trafic

## 3.5. Digital Concept 2: Desktop Manufacturing
relatively low-cost and fairly easy to use. 
3D printing will lead to a new industrial revolution and dramatically alter our economy thus this new emerging digital tool has important implications for the way products are distributed and placed in the marketplace.
A desktop 3D printer is an electronic device, usually about the size of a microwave oven, that is capable of turning digital designs into physical objects through an additive process.

### 3.5.1. How does 3D printing work?
there are lots of different 3D printing 
technologies including selective laser sintering, stereolithography, and fused deposition 
modeling, just to name a few. However, nearly all 3D printers work in one of two different ways, 
they either take a soft material and make it hard, or take a hard material and make it soft. 

soft material -> hard
hard material -> soft


3D printers are computer-controlled devices that contain a printhead, moved by motors in 3 dimensions. 
Design files can come from a variety of sources that could be created using a 3D modeling software package, such as Google SketchUp, could come from a digital scan or could be a digital download from a file-sharing website such as Thingiverse. Thus, if you can download a file, you can create a 3D printed object.
### 3.5.2. what's special about 3D printing?
- Sustainable manufacturing approach - no material waste
- Files areshipped electronically and printed loccaly - no shipping costs
- require no setup cost
	- economies of scale in 3D printing
	-  a small manufacturer can easily compete with a large corporation.
- makes complex objects that come already assembled.
	- There's no other manufacturing process that can make objects in this way without some form of additional assembly.

### 3.5.3. how will 3D printing change business?
3D printing is believed to have the potential to create a new industrial revolution. 
Thus, it's not hard to imagine that 3D printers could have a very similar impact on a variety of traditional physical goods. With this new technology, really any product can be digitized and downloaded. Thus, objects will become downloads. When this happens, it will change everything.

### 3.5.4. Academic insights
self manufacturing via 3D printing by rindfleisch, malter & fisher
\+ Help retailers reduce inventory
\- Harm retailers by enabling customers to create their own products

![[3D Printed Object Typology.png]]
50% creations
5% replacements

Just print it by Weicek, wentzel & Erkin
Those that printed their own objects feel more closely connected to them & display a higher sence of perceived ownership, which should result in more positive evaluations of these products
![[Pasted image 20210524121018.png]]
participants who printed the key-chain, whether they observed it being printed or not, reported a higher degree of liking and a higher willingness to pay compared to participants who did not engage in 3D printing. They also found that this effect was due to an increased sense of perceived ownership. Ithese effects were stronger for hedonic products like toys, then for utilitarian ones like tools, for example. In some, this research suggests that firms that allow consumers to 3D print their own products should achieve positive outcomes in terms of greater liking and a higher willingness to pay.
### 3.5.5. Practical reccomendation
#### 3.5.5.1. Make the physical digital
Digital objects are easily stored, transported and modified
create new objects using digital modeling tools
turn physical products into digital designs

It it blurs the dividing line between the physical and the digital.
All the objects created through desktop manufacturing techniques like 3D printing start with a digital model. Now once an object is digital, it can be easily stored, transported, and modified to meet specific customer demands. Firms can get a head start on this process by creating new objects using digital modeling tools such as SketchUp, and by using a 3D scanner to turn existing physical products into digital 
designs. *digital files are especially helpful for replacement parts* which are costly to store and difficult to transport


#### 3.5.5.2. Let customers customize your design
offers a basic template and then let customers design a product to fit their specific needs
Digitalization can satisfy a broad range of preferences

once firms start thinking about products as digital goods rather than physical ones, new possibilities emerge. Physical goods are difficult and expensive to customize.  with digital products, customization is cheap and easy.
It is even possible to eliminate finished products altogether. Instead, at some point in the future, a firm will be able to offer basic template that let its customers design a product to fit their specific needs. thus the digitization of physical goods makes it easier to satisfy a broad range of customer preferences.
#### 3.5.5.3. Cut out the middleman
3D printers have potential to disrupt how physical goods are distributed
digital distribution saves time/money and allow greater control
Post digital files of products online
- on a website for easy downloading, or can post it on a third-party website of a digital manufacturer such as Voodoo Manufacturing.

#### 3.5.5.4. Done is the engine of more
"The Cult of Done Manifesto"
Because desktop 3D printing is relatively cheap and easy, there is not need for extensive planning
If you have an idea, you can design it and make an initial protopype at your desk immediately.
 Once you have this physical prototype, you can then get a better idea how well it works. You can then tweak your design and print the modified version, and then another one.

## 3.6. Exercise: Thingiverse.com


https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/mzVtOWeITca1bTlniB3Gcg.processed/full/360p/index.mp4?Expires=1621987200&Signature=P-Ojf9-oCiyG9objtHVgfRDRZLVaDuq8-HOHSYEXL5za-JVEvGwc4TghgEkt61084igNg4oQdu3GXCwp6x0bgmBuOz-6ivThJje8bAbYx4o2~9ldFRtaB0Tb8R3agV7xk0oKDAzVjgBGI4-yjjS7XNyh7GaqNUrbFkTKvTjYznc_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A

First of all, record your things name and its number, you see it on top of the URL. Second, what type of object is this? Remember our four categories, is a replacement, a substitute, a solution or a creation.
Third, why did you pick this particular object? 
Finally, your thoughts and how might Thingiverse or a service like this have an impact on product placement?

## 4.2. Basic Concept: Price
### 4.2.1. What is price
Price is the amount that a customer pays for a product.
```ad-question
title: How is price different from the product, promotion, and placement?
Rather than creating value, price captures the value. Thus, having a good pricing strategy is critical for a firm’s profitability and very survival. 
```


### 4.2.2. What to consider when develop pricing strategy?

product’s cost of production - manufacturing cost
what customers are willing to pay - willignes to pay
the prices of competing products - competition pricing



### 4.2.3. Key concepts

#### 4.2.3.1. break-even analysis
[[Introduction to Marketing#5.1.4.2 Break-even analysis]]

#### 4.2.3.2. price elasticity
#### 4.2.3.3. reference prices

### 4.2.4. Foundamental concepts

pricing strategy by firms 
price knowledge among customers

#### 4.2.4.1. pricing strategy
A pricing strategy is a firm’s basic approach to how it prices its products.
```ad-question
title: What are the different pricing strategies?
The most common pricing strategies are: cost-based pricing, competitor-based pricing, and value-based pricing. 
```

##### 4.2.4.1.1. cost-based pricing
Cost-plus pricing
- The price of a product is based upon the *cost of manufacturing* or *acquiring the product* **plus** a commonly accepted *markup* percentage.

```ad-example
title: in the US, most car dealers price cars at their invoice price plus a margin between 5-10%.
collapse: close
```

##### 4.2.4.1.2. competitor-based pricing 
Competitor-based pricing 
the price of a product is based upon closely matching the process of relevant competitors.
```ad-example
title: if the price of gasoline is lowered by one gas station, nearby stations will typically lower their gas price to a match this price.
collapse: close
```

##### 4.2.4.1.3. value-based pricing
focuses on the added value that a product delivers to its customers.
```ad-example
title: For example, a cold soda on a hot day during a sporting event is priced higher (and provides more value) than a soda sitting a store shelf a mile down the road.
collapse: close
coca-cola experimented with this
```


#### 4.2.4.2. price knowledge 

this knowledge helps set price expectations and also gives consumers more power in the marketplace.
for many product categories, consumers have a relatively low level of price knowledge. 
```ad-warning
title: This means that they have relatively low level of power!
collapse: close
```

```ad-warning
title: Not so fast
Although less than half of supermarket shoppers knew the price of the items that they place in their shopping carts, when they see the price of a product they can tell if that price is close to the one they are used to seeing.
```



### 4.2.5. What is changing?
This fixed, firm-centered approach 
- the price wasn’t negotiable
	- For most of the products we purchase, the price has been set by the firm that either makes it or sells it, and we often don’t know the exact price until they see it on the shelf. 

The price that we pay for something is becoming more under our control. *The digital revolution allows consumers to get lots of things for free and choose the price options that fit them best.* [[Marketing in a Digital World#19 Digital Concept 2: Freemium|Freemium]] - new business model and [[Marketing in a Digital World#17 Digital Concept 1: Pay What You Want (PWYW)|Pay What You Want]] ^p2e3am
```ad-warning
title: Mooing from fixed prices to flexible prices
collapse: close
```


## 4.3. Digital Concept 1: Pay What You Want (PWYW)
```ad-warning
title: Picking the right price is an extremely important part of a firm’s marketing strategy
The problem is that what is just right for you may be too high (or too low) for me. 
```
If the price is too high, firms will lose potential sales, it if is too low, it will lose potential revenue. 
```ad-question
title: So, what should I do
Allow price to vary
```
 
### 4.3.1. Price segmentation
```ad-example
title: Movie theatres offer discounts to demographic groups that traditionally have lower incomes, such as students and senior citizens.
```
```ad-question
title: What is price segmentation
Allowing price to variy according to the value that a product provides to various potential customers
```

```ad-question
title: Who sets the price then?
The setting of these different price segments has been traditionally determined by firms rather than customers. A few firms have experimented with the idea of allowing their customers to segment themselves by letting them name their own price (Pay What you Want)
```

### 4.3.2. Pay What You Want (PWYW)
It is ideally suited to digital marketing because of the increased ability of firms to *control the distribution* of their product and to track customer payment activity. In addition, since the marginal cost of a digital good is close to zero, this strategy is relatively *low risk*.

```ad-example
title: Radiohead: In 2007, the British rock band Radiohead offered its new album, In Rainbows for sale using a PWYW strategy. This approach *received worldwide attention* and was the launching pad for the PWYW movement.
collapse: close
```

```ad-example
title: Headsets.com: In recent years, this online headset retailer has experimented with a PWYW strategy as a means of rewarding customer loyalty. *Nearly all of its customers paid the suggested price (or close to it)*. According to its CEO Mike Faith, *this strategy has resulted in a 30% increase in its return on investment.*
collapse: close
```

```ad-example
title: Have you used Wikipedia for free? Did you ever wonder how Wikipedia makes money?
Although its content is user-generated, Wikipedia has lots of other expenses, such as the cost of its servers, technical support and attorney fees. Thus to stay in business, *Wikipedia relies upon a PWYW strategy through donations* to the Wikimedia Foundation and currently has over $75 million in assets.
collapseL close
```

Pay What You Want is a pricing strategy that *lets customers decide how much they want to pay* for a particular product. Although *a firm may suggest a price*, *its customers are free to pay less (or more)* than this price (including nothing).

### 4.3.3. Key issues
#### 4.3.3.1. Do people actually pay when they don’t have to?

Economic claims that customers want to get as much as they can for as little as they have to pay. However, in reality, many people are not just self-interested economic actors but also social beings who are governed by norms of honesty and fairness. Thus, *while some do behave as economists suggest, many do not.* 

#### 4.3.3.2. How can a firm make money by giving its product away for free?
A firm can’t make money (or stay in business) if it continuously gives its products away for free. Fortunately, *many people will pay something for a product* even under a PWYW strategy. Moreover, PWYW strategy is novel and newsworthy and when a firm employs this approach, it usually gets a lot of attention. This often results in *increased traffic and customer volume*.


#### 4.3.3.3. Is this pricing strategy sustainable?
PWYW strategy is more likely to be successful if:
- it is offered for a limited duration
- available for only a subset of a firm’s product offerings
OR
- limited to certain set of buyers. 

PWYW appears to be an approach that is a good change of pace but not sustainable as a long-term pricing strategy.

### 4.3.4. Academic Insights
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.044
- Everyone paid something
	- none of the customers asked to be given 
the product (or service) for free.
- prices paid were 15% lower than the normal price
- average volume of sales was 10% higher
	-  price went down but quantity went up
- Higher revenues for resturants, lower for movie theather

```ad-question
title: What if:
We start it as a bug in the app, allowing PWYW in after they received the product. In other words, let the customers discover the new feature, giving them a reason to believe that they hacked the system and saved money. Would they feel special?
```

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1094670519835308
consumers paid more after they received a product or service. 

```ad-warning
title: due to uncertainty and that consumers tend to pay less before they see a product or service because they are uncertain about what they will be getting.
collapse: close
```

### 4.3.5. Practical recomendations
#### 4.3.5.1. Set a Reference Price
- clearly display the price of a comparable item
- decrease their temptation to pay little or nothing

#### 4.3.5.2. focus on Marginal Costs
-  best employed for products that have a low marginal cost.
	-  digital goods - music, text, and video
-   pairing a digital PWYW product with a physical product that has a relatively high listed price.

#### 4.3.5.3. Try a Limited Rollout
- a limited range of a firm’s product offerings or for a limited duration of time.
- this pricing strategy is only available to its returning customers.
- to reduce risk while still benefiting from the attention

#### 4.3.5.4. Use Charity Appeals
- PWYW strategy is more likely to be successful if the seller announces that some or all of the proceeds will be donated to charity
- This sends a signal that the seller is generous, which will in turn encourage customers to exhibit generosity and thus be more likely to pay a higher price
- employs this strategy as a means of encouraging higher payment levels from its customers


## 4.4. Case Study: Panera
https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/7XNkCuXNTh2zZArlzW4dSQ.processed/full/360p/index.mp4?Expires=1621987200&Signature=TI6tWrByfBbHCOJND0fpgx-986GmQ5B1r-HoqRRV9el6h93iUos10dAqQNVxXgszz4cshEW2kTJ~SBrWbwBTME1aTpwfN1wnygj0mtrMD5KA2EhO8qCa9uA2XqyOR1FTftD4NwumZHAfqZi6UsQt9EyCdapsV2TOhvoaT5xQOr0_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A

## 4.5. Digital Concept 2: Freemium

Product, Promotion and Placement are the ways in which firms create value for 
customers. In contrast, Price provides a way for firms to capture this value in the form of financial payment for their efforts. Thus, setting the right price is a critically important part of the marketing equation.
Our traditional understanding of how pricing works is becoming increasingly challenged by the rise of new digital tools. 
 Freemium model, which allows customers to access a portion of a product or a service for free and then pay only for any added offerings that they would like to have. 
 	- The Freemium model is quite common for smartphone apps and can also be found in a number of other digital domains, including software, social media sites and communication platforms.

```ad-example
title:
Dropbox
LinkedIn
The New York Times
```

```ad-warning
title: a Freemium is a digital product or service that offers a set of basic features for free but charges a price (usually a monthly or yearly subscription) for a set of premium features. In essence, a Freemium combines “Free” & “Premium.
!!! ad-question
	title: Why does it work?
	Because the marginal cost of adding a new user is close to zero
```

### 4.5.1. 5% rule of tumb
a small percentage of paying customers can provide enough revenue to cover the costs of serving all of its free customers.  In general, most Freemium platforms seem to have a conversion rate somewhere between 2% to 5%.

### 4.5.2. zero price effect
: It order to succeed as a Freemium, a business needs to strike a balance between offering enough free features to attract new customers, while putting enough premium features behind a paywall in order to convert enough of these customers into paying members.

- balance free features (attract new customers) and premium features behind a paywall

```ad-question
title: What is a zero price effect?
When the free options provide so much value that there is little incentive toobtain the premium version.
```

```ad-question
title: Is obsidian freemium?
collapse: close
```

```ad-question
title: How to reduce the zero price effect?
- by allowing free users to temporarily see/use the features available to premium subscribers
```

### 4.5.3. Twin Roles

We usually think of customers as providing value to a firm through their purchase activity. Thus, according to our traditional perspective, customers who don’t pay anything are not worth anything.
In contrast, Freemium customers (who don’t initially pay anything) provide value in at least two ways:
- First, free users can provide value by upgrading to a premium membership.
- Second, free users can provide value through positive word of mouth and telling others about a free offering. - 
- a free user is typically worth as much as 15%-25% of a premium subscriber.

### 4.5.4. Academic insights
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401218311812

Quality,
Enjoyment, 
Social Value 
Economic value

all four types of perceived value are positively associated with intention to use a Freemium game. But only Social Value had a direct positive association with the intention to purchase premium offerings. only Social Value had a direct positive association with the intention to purchase premium offerings. Social Value (how a product or service affects an individual’s self-concept and how they are viewed by others) **is the strongest predictor of whether a consumer will upgrade from free to premium features**. Thus, firms that employ Freemium model should *consider the value that their premium features provide in terms of enhancing Social Value* and that this form of value may be more important than more traditional considerations such as an offering’s price and quality.

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjV-9258uLwAhUQa8AKHSO3CqwQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1002%2Fmar.21211&usg=AOvVaw243aYPXtJIDYZ738u-lvNs

- 2 ways customers view freemium offerings
	- (1) Free Mentality—the perception that all of its features should be freely available 
		- 
	- (2)Price-Quality Inference—the perception that the free offering may be of lower quality than the premium version. 

> Free Mentality will strengthen the Zero-Price Effect while Price-Quality Inference will weaken the Zero-Price Effect. 
> consumers view Freemiums from both a Free Mentality and Price-Quality perspective in about equal amounts
> Price-Quality Inferences have the strongest impact and that these inferences significantly weaken the Zero-Price Effect.
> this study suggests that firms that employ a Freemium model should clearly communicate the quality benefits and features for the premium version of their offerings in order to gain a higher level of conversion.

### 4.5.5. Prectical reccomendation

#### 4.5.5.1. Add New Features
- It is easier to convert *early free subscribers* into paying customers than late adopters
	- The initial buyers of any new offering are typically innovators and early adopters who are quite different than later buyers. 
- Make offerings more appealing over time by adding new features


#### 4.5.5.2. Be Sticky
The more sticky they are, the harder it is for customers to switch to a competitive offering. Freemium products and services can be sticky in at least two different ways:
1. Network effect
- A network effect occurs when the value of an offering for an existing customer increases as it gains more customers.
	- Linked In’s value becomes higher as it expands its subscriber base, as each new subscriber is a potential network contact. Thus, Linked In gets stickier as it gains more customers.
2. switching costs
- make it difficult to leave a platform for another provider. Due to these switching costs, once a customer joins a Freemium platform, they are likely to stay there.

#### 4.5.5.3. Be Restrictive
In order to successfully convert free users into paid subscribers, Freemium platforms need to offer some benefits that are restricted to only their premium members. 
- restricted capacity
- restricted features
#### 4.5.5.4. Reduce your Marketing Costs

In a traditional business model, firms usually launch an expensive advertising campaign to raise awareness for their offerings and acquire new customers. A Freemium model allows firms to greatly reduce their upfront marketing costs because the free nature of their offering is a low cost and effective way to quickly acquire a large number of customers. Also, when we get something for free, we often tell our family, friends, and colleagues about it, so Freemium platforms often obtain a high degree of positive word-of-mouth, which helps attract even more customers. Thus, firms that employ a Freemium model should be able to spend much less upfront on marketing compared to a more traditional type of business.
